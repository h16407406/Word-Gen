 Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term.

Changes observed in Earth’s climate since the mid-20th century are driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, raising Earth’s average surface temperature. Natural processes, which have been overwhelmed by human activities, can also contribute to climate change, including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El Niño, La Niña and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity, changes in the Sun’s energy output, variations in Earth’s orbit).

Scientists use observations from the ground, air, and space, along with computer models, to monitor and study past, present, and future climate change. Climate data records provide evidence of climate change key indicators, such as global land and ocean temperature increases; rising sea levels; ice loss at Earth’s poles and in mountain glaciers; frequency and severity changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods, and precipitation; and cloud and vegetation cover changes.

“Climate change” and “global warming” are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Similarly, the terms "weather" and "climate" are sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different spatial- and timescales.

What Is Global Warming?

This graph illustrates the change in global surface temperature relative to 1951-1980 average temperatures, with the year 2020 statistically tying with 2016 for hottest on record (Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies). Learn more about global surface temperature here.

Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere. This term is not interchangeable with the term "climate change."

Since the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased Earth’s global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a number that is currently increasing by more than 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. The current warming trend is unequivocally the result of human activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over millennia.

Weather vs. Climate
“If you don’t like the weather in New England, just wait a few minutes.” <br>- Mark Twain

Weather refers to atmospheric conditions that occur locally over short periods of time—from minutes to hours or days. Familiar examples include rain, snow, clouds, winds, floods, or thunderstorms.

Climate, on the other hand, refers to the long-term (usually at least 30 years) regional or even global average of temperature, humidity, and rainfall patterns over seasons, years, or decades.
global warming is the current rise in earth's average temperature caused primarily by human produced greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. average global temperature has increased by about one degree celsius since the industrial revolution and is projected to rise an additional two to four degrees celsius by two thousand one hundred. increased temperatures are causing sea levels to rise and weather patterns to change due to melting ice caps and thermal expansion of oceans. while some natural climate change has occurred throughout earth's history, the current changes are happening much faster than past changes due to human activity.

global warming is mostly because people burn things like gasoline for cars and natural gas to keep houses warm. the heat from the burning itself only makes the world a tiny bit warmer. it is the carbon dioxide from the burning which is the biggest part of the problem. among the greenhouse gases the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the main cause of global warming. when people burn fossil fuels like coal oil and natural gas this adds carbon dioxide into the air. when people cut down many trees this means less carbon dioxide is taken out of the atmosphere by those plants.

as earth's surface temperature becomes hotter the sea level rises. this is partly because water expands when it gets warmer. it is also partly because warm temperatures make glaciers and ice caps melt. the sea level rise causes coastal areas to flood. weather patterns including where and how much rain or snow there is are changing. deserts will probably increase in size. colder areas will warm up faster than warm areas. strong storms may become more likely and farming may not make as much food.

global warming results when greenhouse gases trap heat in earth's atmosphere. these gases act like a blanket around earth keeping it warm. without them earth would be much colder. there are natural greenhouse gases like water vapour and clouds but human activity has added carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide. these additional gases trap more heat and cause the planet to warm.

global warming has many effects on people animals and the environment. higher temperatures can cause heat waves droughts and wildfires. melting ice reduces habitat for animals like polar bears. ocean warming and acidification harm plants and animals under water. rising seas flood coastal areas and can destroy homes farmland and habitats. more extreme weather events like storms floods and cyclones may happen more often.

people and nature can adapt to some changes like building sea walls planting different crops and protecting forests. but some large changes are too big or too fast to adapt to. to lessen global warming people can use cleaner energy like solar wind and hydropower. we can also waste less energy travel less by car make buildings more efficient plant trees and eat less meat. governments can set rules and laws to reduce greenhouse gases and help people change.

global warming often called climate change is one of the biggest problems the world faces today. even a small change in temperature can cause big effects over time. our actions in the coming years will help decide how hot the planet becomes and how well people and plants and animals survive.


Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1850—the year that accurate recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. Since 1981, however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last 40 years, we’ve seen the global annual temperature rise by 0.2 degrees Celsius, or 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.

The result? A planet that has never been hotter. The 10 most recent years are the warmest years on record. And the warmer it gets, the more probable it becomes that we trigger climate tipping points (such as rapid glacier melt or thawing permafrost) that can transform natural systems into entirely different states and lead to more warming.

In 2015, the Paris Agreement codified the recommendation of climate scientists to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Working toward that goal continues to give us our best chance to stave off the worst, most devastating effects of climate change: the extreme droughts, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and other disasters that are so widespread and costly to both our infrastructure and our health.

What causes global warming?

Global warming results from the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases that trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere. This trapped energy comes from incoming solar radiation absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-radiated back into the atmosphere as infrared energy.

Though natural cycles and fluctuations have caused the planet's climate to change continually over the last 800,000 years, it is human activity that has driven our current era of global warming. In particular, our burning of fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, gasoline, and natural gas—has led to the greenhouse effect. In the United States, the largest source of greenhouse gases is transportation, followed closely by electricity production and industrial activity. (Learn about the natural and human causes of climate change.)

To support global efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the United States now faces the monumental (yet achievable) task of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero no later than 2050. We must also fulfill our commitments to help developing nations meet their climate goals—a responsibility that we (and other rich, polluting nations) are currently falling short on. In better news, at the most recent United Nations climate convention, countries agreed to work toward scaling up climate finance to developing countries to at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035.

How is global warming linked to extreme weather?

As the earth’s atmosphere heats up, it holds more water, changing weather patterns and fueling more severe rainfall events. At the same time, warmer air causes more moisture to evaporate from the planet’s surface in dry weather, resulting in more frequent and intense droughts and heat waves.

A 2023 paper by two NASA scientists published in the journal Nature Water confirmed the “wet-gets-wetter, dry-gets-drier hypothesis” through a review of extreme weather events across five continents from 2002 to 2021. Among the most dramatic was a pluvial (intense period of rainfall) that began in 2019 in central Africa and was still ongoing as the study concluded. The event caused Lake Victoria’s water levels to rise by more than 3 feet and resulted in severe flooding in surrounding areas. Meanwhile a 2015–'16 drought in Brazil led to empty reservoirs and water rationing across some cities. The scientists concluded that “the global total intensity of major extreme events appears to be increasing as the world warms.”

Ocean temperatures are getting warmer too—which means that tropical storms can pick up more energy. The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season included a record-breaking 30 tropical storms, 6 major hurricanes, and 13 hurricanes altogether. With increased intensity comes increased damage and death, particularly as coastal populations grow and coastal development accelerates. Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters have been increasing in recent years; the United States experienced an unprecedented 28 of these in 2023.

What are the other effects of global warming?

Each year scientists learn more about the consequences of global warming, and each year we also gain new evidence of its devastating impact on people and the planet. They touch on every facet of our lives—our economy and livelihoods, our health, our food supply, and our ways of life. Heat stress is killing workers. Allergies, asthma, and infectious disease outbreaks are becoming more common due to increased growth of pollen-producing ragweed, higher levels of air pollution, and the spread of conditions favorable to ticks and mosquitoes. Communities are migrating from scorched or flooded homelands. Melting ice is reshaping environments and impacting lives from the mountains to the coasts. (Learn more about the effects of climate change.)

Though everyone is affected by climate change, not everyone is affected equally. Indigenous Peoples, people of color, and the economically marginalized are typically hit the hardest, due in part to environmental racism. Inequities built into our housing, health care, and labor systems make these communities more vulnerable to the worst impacts of climate change—even though these same communities have done the least to contribute to it.

Where does the United States stand in terms of global-warming contributors?

In recent years, China has taken the lead in global-warming pollution, producing about 26 percent of all CO2 emissions. The United States comes in second. Despite making up just 4 percent of the world’s population, our nation produces a sobering 13 percent of all global CO2 emissions—nearly as much as the European Union and India (third and fourth place) combined. And America is still number one, by far, in cumulative emissions over the past 150 years. Given this outsize role in accelerating global warming, the United States must step up its financial commitments to bringing about a cleaner, safer, and more equitable future. Our responsibility matters to other countries, and it should matter to us, too.

Is the United States doing anything to prevent global warming?

We’ve started. But in order to avoid the worsening effects of climate change, we need to do a lot more—together with other countries—to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and transition to clean energy sources.

Under the first administration of President Donald Trump, the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement, rolled back or eliminated dozens of clean air protections, and opened up federally managed lands, including culturally sacred national monuments, to fossil fuel development.

The administration of President Joe Biden subsequently worked to pass record investments in electric vehicles and other clean energy sectors in the form of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. And through the Justice40 Initiative, they built in climate justice, requiring that at least 40 percent of the overall benefits from certain federal climate and infrastructure programs go toward disinvested and overburdened communities.

Those policies, coupled with the work of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rein in the largest sources of climate pollution across the energy and transportation sectors, brought us significantly closer to meeting our climate goals. Evidence has shown that the United States is on track to reduce its GHG emissions by 38 to 56 percent below 2005 levels in 2035, a significant increase from the pace of annual emissions abatement from 2005 to 2023. However, that progress is now uncertain with the second Trump administration promising more rollbacks of climate-focused regulations, including projects intending to address environmental injustice.

Despite the lack of cooperation from the Trump administration, local and state governments made great strides from 2017 to 2021 through efforts like the American Cities Climate Challenge and ongoing collaborations like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Meanwhile, industry and business leaders continued to create and adopt new clean energy technologies and increase energy efficiency in buildings, appliances, and industrial processes. This public-private sector collaboration remains key to achieving our climate goals.

Today the American automotive industry is finding new ways to produce cars and trucks that are more fuel efficient and is committing itself to putting more and more zero-emission electric vehicles on the road. Developers, cities, and community advocates are coming together to make sure that new affordable housing is built with efficiency in mind, reducing energy consumption and lowering electric and heating bills for residents. And renewable energy continues to surge as the costs associated with its production and distribution keep falling. These trends have also fueled record job growth—at the beginning of 2024, 3.4 million workers were employed in clean energy in the United States.

Is global warming too big a problem for me to help tackle?

No! While we can’t win the fight without large-scale government action at the national level, we also can’t do it without the help of individuals who are willing to use their voices, hold government and industry leaders to account, and make changes in their daily habits.

Wondering how you can be a part of the fight against global warming? Reduce your own carbon footprint by taking a few easy steps: Make conserving energy a part of your daily routine and your decisions as a consumer. When you shop for new appliances like refrigerators, washers, and dryers, look for products with the government’s Energy Star label; they meet a higher standard for energy efficiency than the minimum federal requirements. When you buy a car, look for one with the highest gas mileage and lowest emissions, and consider how an EV can help you save in the long run. You can also reduce your emissions by taking public transportation or carpooling when possible.

And while new federal and state standards are a step in the right direction, much more needs to be done. Voice your support of climate-friendly and climate change preparedness policies, and tell your representatives that equitably transitioning from dirty fossil fuels to clean power should be a top priority—because it’s vital to building healthy, more secure communities.

This article is about the present-day human-induced rise in global temperatures. For natural historical climate trends, see Climate variability and change.
"Global warming" redirects here. For other uses, see Climate change (disambiguation) and Global warming (disambiguation).
The global map shows sea temperature rises of 0.5 to 1 degree Celsius; land temperature rises of 1 to 2 degrees Celsius; and Arctic temperature rises of up to 4 degrees Celsius.
Changes in surface air temperature over the past 50 years.[1] The Arctic has warmed the most, and temperatures on land have generally increased more than sea surface temperatures.
Timeseries of global warming from 1880 to 2020 compared to simulated temperatures given only natural forcing. The first shows a positive trend since around 1950 and the second stays relatively flat.
Earth's average surface air temperature has increased almost 1.5 °C (about 2.5 °F) since the Industrial Revolution. Natural forces cause some variability, but the 20-year average shows the progressive influence of human activity.[2]
Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel burning since the Industrial Revolution.[3][4] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases.[5] These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.[6]

Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[7] Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline.[8] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[9] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[10] Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.[11]

Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss.[12] Human migration and conflict can also be a result.[13] The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century.[14] Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming.[15] Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached.[16] Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.[17][18]

Examples of some effects of climate change: Wildfire intensified by heat and drought, bleaching of corals occurring more often due to marine heatwaves, and worsening droughts compromising water supplies.
Many climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century, with 2024 the warmest on record at +1.60 °C (2.88 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850.[20][21] Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet.[22] Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °C". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century.[23] Limiting warming to 1.5 °C would require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.[24][25]

There is widespread support for climate action worldwide.[26][27] Fossil fuel use can be phased out by conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution. These energy sources include wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power.[28] Cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes.[29] Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.[30]

Terminology
Before the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution. Scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time.[31] In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common, often being used interchangeably.[32][33][34] Scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, such as precipitation changes.[31]

Climate change can also be used more broadly to include changes to the climate that have happened throughout Earth's history.[35] Global warming—used as early as 1975[36]—became the more popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S. Senate.[37] Since the 2000s, climate change has increased usage.[38] Various scientists, politicians and media may use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and may use the term global heating instead of global warming.[39][40]

Over the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages. One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5 °C and 1.5 °C warmer than before the start of global warming.[43] This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today. The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7 °C colder. This period has sea levels that were over 125 metres (410 ft) lower than today.[44]

Temperatures stabilized in the current interglacial period beginning 11,700 years ago.[45] This period also saw the start of agriculture.[46] Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions. Temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions.[47][48] Climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores.[49][50]

Warming since the Industrial Revolution

In recent decades, new high temperature records have substantially outpaced new low temperature records on a growing portion of Earth's surface.[51]

There has been an increase in ocean heat content during recent decades as the oceans absorb over 90% of the heat from global warming.[52]
Around 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage.[53] Between the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming, as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions. Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and cause global dimming. After 1970, the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature.[54][55][56]

Ongoing changes in climate have had no precedent for several thousand years.[57] Multiple independent datasets all show worldwide increases in surface temperature,[58] at a rate of around 0.2 °C per decade.[59] The 2014–2023 decade warmed to an average 1.19 °C [1.06–1.30 °C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900).[60] Not every single year was warmer than the last: internal climate variability processes can make any year 0.2 °C warmer or colder than the average.[61] From 1998 to 2013, negative phases of two such processes, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)[62] and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)[63] caused a short slower period of warming called the "global warming hiatus".[64] After the "hiatus", the opposite occurred, with 2024 well above the recent average at more than +1.5 °C.[65] This is why the temperature change is defined in terms of a 20-year average, which reduces the noise of hot and cold years and decadal climate patterns, and detects the long-term signal.[66]: 5 [67]

A wide range of other observations reinforce the evidence of warming.[68][69] The upper atmosphere is cooling, because greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's surface, and so less heat is radiating into space.[70] Warming reduces average snow cover and forces the retreat of glaciers. At the same time, warming also causes greater evaporation from the oceans, leading to more atmospheric humidity, more and heavier precipitation.[71][72] Plants are flowering earlier in spring, and thousands of animal species have been permanently moving to cooler areas.[73]

Differences by region
Different regions of the world warm at different rates. The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature.[74] This is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat.[75] The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean.[76][77] The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.[78]

The Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice. As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat.[79] Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming.[80] Arctic surface temperatures are increasing between three and four times faster than in the rest of the world.[81][82][83] Melting of ice sheets near the poles weakens both the Atlantic and the Antarctic limb of thermohaline circulation, which further changes the distribution of heat and precipitation around the globe.[84][85][86][87]

Future global temperatures

CMIP6 multi-model projections of global surface temperature changes for the year 2090 relative to the 1850–1900 average. The current trajectory for warming by the end of the century is roughly halfway between these two extremes.[23][88][89]
The World Meteorological Organization estimates there is almost a 50% chance of the five-year average global temperature exceeding +1.5 °C between 2024 and 2028.[90] The IPCC expects the 20-year average to exceed +1.5 °C in the early 2030s.[91]

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2021) included projections that by 2100 global warming is very likely to reach 1.0–1.8 °C under a scenario with very low emissions of greenhouse gases, 2.1–3.5 °C under an intermediate emissions scenario, or 3.3–5.7 °C under a very high emissions scenario.[92] The warming will continue past 2100 in the intermediate and high emission scenarios,[93][94] with future projections of global surface temperatures by year 2300 being similar to millions of years ago.[95]

The remaining carbon budget for staying beneath certain temperature increases is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases.[96] According to UNEP, global warming can be kept below 1.5 °C with a 50% chance if emissions after 2023 do not exceed 200 gigatonnes of CO2. This corresponds to around 4 years of current emissions. To stay under 2.0 °C, the carbon budget is 900 gigatonnes of CO2, or 16 years of current emissions.[97]

Causes of recent global temperature rise
Main article: Causes of climate change

Physical drivers of global warming that has happened so far. Future global warming potential for long lived drivers like carbon dioxide emissions is not represented. Whiskers on each bar show the possible error range.
The climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years, decades or even centuries. For example, El Niño events cause short-term spikes in surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term cooling.[98] Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale.[99] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings.[100] Examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.[101]

To determine the human contribution to climate change, unique "fingerprints" for all potential causes are developed and compared with both observed patterns and known internal climate variability.[102] For example, solar forcing—whose fingerprint involves warming the entire atmosphere—is ruled out because only the lower atmosphere has warmed.[103] Atmospheric aerosols produce a smaller, cooling effect. Other drivers, such as changes in albedo, are less impactful.[104]

Greenhouse gases
Main articles: Greenhouse gas, Greenhouse gas emissions, Greenhouse effect, and Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere

CO2 concentrations over the last 800,000 years as measured from ice cores (blue/green) and directly (black)
Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface. The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it. This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time.[105]

While water vapour (≈50%) and clouds (≈25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they primarily change as a function of temperature and are therefore mostly considered to be feedbacks that change climate sensitivity. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as CO2 (≈20%), tropospheric ozone,[106] CFCs and nitrous oxide are added or removed independently from temperature, and are therefore considered to be external forcings that change global temperatures.[107]

Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 °C warmer than it would have been in their absence.[108][109] Human activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas),[110] has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In 2022, the concentrations of CO2 and methane had increased by about 50% and 164%, respectively, since 1750.[111] These CO2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 14 million years.[112] Concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years.[113]


The Global Carbon Project shows how additions to CO2 since 1880 have been caused by different sources ramping up one after another.
Global human-caused greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of CO2. Of these emissions, seventyfive% was CO2, eighteen% was methane, four% was nitrous oxide, and two% was fluorinated gases.[114] CO2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity.[5] Additional CO2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the CO2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertilizer.[115][116][117][118] Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction.[119][120] Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertilizer.[121][122]

While methane only lasts in the atmosphere for an average of twelve years,[123] CO2 lasts much longer. The Earth's surface absorbs CO2 as part of the carbon cycle. While plants on land and in the ocean absorb most excess emissions of CO2 every year, that CO2 is returned to the atmosphere when biological matter is digested, burns, or decays.[124] Land-surface carbon sink processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, remove about twentynine% of annual global CO2 emissions.[125] The ocean has absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted CO2 over the last two decades.[126] CO2 is only removed from the atmosphere for the long term when it is stored in the Earth's crust, which is a process that can take millions of years to complete.[124]

Land surface changes

The rate of global tree cover loss has approximately doubled since twothousandone, to an annual loss approaching an area the size of Italy.[127]
Around thirty% of Earth's land area is largely unusable for humans (glaciers, deserts, etc.), twentysix% is forests, 10% is shrubland and thirtyfour% is agricultural land.[128] Deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming,[129] as the destroyed trees release CO2, and are not replaced by new trees, removing that carbon sink.[130] Between twothousandone and twothousandeightteen, twentyseven% of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock. Another twentyfour% has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems. twentysix% was due to logging for wood and derived products, and wildfires have accounted for the remaining twentyseven%.[131] Some forests have not been fully cleared, but were already degraded by these impacts. Restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink.[132]

Local vegetation cover impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also modify the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns.[133] In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, and forest restoration can make local temperatures cooler.[132] At latitudes closer to the poles, there is a cooling effect as forest is replaced by snow-covered (and more reflective) plains.[133] Globally, these increases in surface albedo have been the dominant direct influence on temperature from land use change. Thus, land use change to date is estimated to have a slight cooling effect.[134]

Global warming refers to the increase in the planet’s overall average temperature in recent decades. Natural processes have always affected Earth’s temperature and climate, but more recently, the planet’s temperature and climate have changed at a higher pace than nature alone can explain. These rapid changes are due to human activities and the widespread use of fossil fuels for energy.

Fossil fuels include coal, oil and natural gas. Burning fossil fuels causes what is known as the “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere. The greenhouse effect happens when the sun’s rays penetrate the atmosphere, and the Earth’s surface reflects that heat. Some of the gasses in the atmosphere then trap heat over Earth. Gasses emitted by the burning of fossil fuels are very good at trapping heat and preventing it from leaving the atmosphere. These greenhouse gasses are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons and water vapor. The excess heat in the atmosphere has caused the planet’s average global temperature to rise over time, otherwise known as global warming.

The Industrial Revolution, beginning in the mid-eighteenthth century, led to the start of an anthropogenic (human-caused) rise in greenhouse gas emissions from Europe and the United States. The invention of the coal-fired steam engine introduced coal as a major source of energy. Soon it was heating homes and fueling machines in factories.

Since that time, the burning of fossil fuels has steadily increased. Today, many countries around the world use fossil fuels to generate energy for electricity, heat and transportation. Emissions of greenhouse gasses have skyrocketed in the last 100 years, and especially since the nineteeneighties. This has accelerated the rise in Earth’s temperature.

Global warming has presented humans with another issue: climate change. People often use the terms “global warming” and “climate change” interchangeably, but they are different. Global warming refers to Earth’s rising average temperature, while climate change refers to changes in weather patterns and growing seasons around the world. Global warming causes climate change, which poses a serious threat to life on Earth.

Humans are feeling the impact of global warming around the world as climate change brings intense droughts, wildfires and extreme storms with heavier rainfall. Higher temperatures are altering ecosystems, forcing animals to migrate to cooler places to survive. Scientists predict that, if nothing is done to lower global temperatures, many species will go extinct.

The ocean is also warming, and glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets are melting. This is causing sea levels to rise, creating flooding problems for many people who live on islands and in coastal communities.

Corals have been a symbol of the consequences of a warmer ocean. Many coral reefs—home to thousands of species of fish and other organisms—are dying. National Geographic Explorer Shireen Rahimi is an underwater storyteller who focuses her lens on the impact of global warming on tropical coral reefs. Her images capture humans’ relationships to the changing seas in the South Pacific, the Coral Triangle, and the Caribbean. Rahimi is dedicated to telling personal stories that encourage environmental action.

Countries around the world are trying to lower greenhouse gas emissions to slow global warming. In twothousandfifteen, nearly twohundred countries signed the Paris Agreement at a United Nations Climate Change conference. The international treaty tasks each country with lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The goal is to slow the pace of global warming and prevent Earth’s temperature from rising two°C (three°F) above pre-industrial temperatures.

The principal causes are the widespread burning of fossil fuels including coal, oil and gas for electricity, heating, cooling and transportation, leading to the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Unable to escape into space, these gases become trapped in the atmosphere, causing the planet to gradually warm over many decades. This then has an effect on climatic patterns, leading to long-term climate change that brings more storms, floods, droughts, forest fires and more extreme temperatures. Melting ice caps bring rising sea levels that threaten coastal cities, while greenhouse gas that are absorbed by oceans make them more acidic, threatening coral and marine life.

The Paris Agreement seeks to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century, and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees. According to a report issued in October 2018 by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Earth has already warmed by between 0.8 degrees and 1.2 degrees since 1750, with a consensus of an average of 1.0 degrees of warming. Limiting total warming to 1.5 degrees – i.e. allowing another 0.5 degrees of warming – requires the world to become effectively carbon-neutral by 2050.

Evidence of rising temperatures can be seen in that 10 of the warmest years in recorded history have occurred since 2005, according to the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The hottest was in 2016, when the Earth’s atmosphere was on average 0.94 degrees warmer than the global mean since 1880. In 2019, several nations set new record national temperatures during summer heatwaves that exceeded 40 degrees in Europe. The records were broken in 29 countries for the period from 1 May to 30 August in 2019, according to the California-based climate institute Berkeley Earth. Its research shows that over the summer, there were 1,200 instances of places in the northern hemisphere that were the hottest they'd ever been in a given month.

Human-induced warming reached approximately 1°C (likely between 0.8°C and 1.2°C) above pre-industrial levels in 2017, increasing at 0.2°C (likely between 0.1°C and 0.3°C) per decade (high confidence). Global warming is defined in this report as an increase in combined surface air and sea surface temperatures averaged over the globe and over a 30-year period. Unless otherwise specified, warming is expressed relative to the period 1850–1900, used as an approximation of pre-industrial temperatures in AR5. For periods shorter than 30 years, warming refers to the estimated average temperature over the 30 years centred on that shorter period, accounting for the impact of any temperature fluctuations or trend within those 30 years. Accordingly, warming from pre- industrial levels to the decade 2006–2015 is assessed to be 0.87°C (likely between 0.75°C and 0.99°C). Since 2000, the estimated level of human-induced warming has been equal to the level of observed warming with a likely range of ±20% accounting for uncertainty due to contributions from solar and volcanic activity over the historical period (high confidence). {1.2.1}

Warming greater than the global average has already been experienced in many regions and seasons, with higher average warming over land than over the ocean (high confidence). Most land regions are experiencing greater warming than the global average, while most ocean regions are warming at a slower rate. Depending on the temperature dataset considered, 20–40% of the global human population live in regions that, by the decade 2006–2015, had already experienced warming of more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial in at least one season (medium confidence). {1.2.1, 1.2.2}

Past emissions alone are unlikely to raise global-mean temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (medium confidence), but past emissions do commit to other changes, such as further sea level rise (high confidence). If all anthropogenic emissions (including aerosol-related) were reduced to zero immediately, any further warming beyond the 1°C already experienced would likely be less than 0.5°C over the next two to three decades (high confidence), and likely less than 0.5°C on a century time scale (medium confidence), due to the opposing effects of different climate processes and drivers. A warming greater than 1.5°C is therefore not geophysically unavoidable: whether it will occur depends on future rates of emission reductions. {1.2.3, 1.2.4}

1.5°C emission pathways are defined as those that, given current knowledge of the climate response, provide a one- in-two to two-in-three chance of warming either remaining below 1.5°C or returning to 1.5°C by around 2100 following an overshoot. Overshoot pathways are characterized by the peak magnitude of the overshoot, which may have implications for impacts. All 1.5°C pathways involve limiting cumulative emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, and substantial reductions in other climate forcers (high confidence). Limiting cumulative emissions requires either reducing net global emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases to zero before the cumulative limit is reached, or net negative global emissions (anthropogenic removals) after the limit is exceeded. {1.2.3, 1.2.4, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1 and 2}

This report assesses projected impacts at a global average warming of 1.5°C and higher levels of warming. Global warming of 1.5°C is associated with global average surface temperatures fluctuating naturally on either side of 1.5°C, together with warming substantially greater than 1.5°C in many regions and seasons (high confidence), all of which must be considered in the assessment of impacts. Impacts at 1.5°C of warming also depend on the emission pathway to 1.5°C. Very different impacts result from pathways that remain below 1.5°C versus pathways that return to 1.5°C after a substantial overshoot, and when temperatures stabilize at 1.5°C versus a transient warming past 1.5°C (medium confidence). {1.2.3, 1.3}

Ethical considerations, and the principle of equity in particular, are central to this report, recognizing that many of the impacts of warming up to and beyond 1.5°C, and some potential impacts of mitigation actions required to limit warming to 1.5°C, fall disproportionately on the poor and vulnerable (high confidence). Equity has procedural and distributive dimensions and requires fairness in burden sharing both between generations and between and within nations. In framing the objective of holding the increase in the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C, the Paris Agreement associates the principle of equity with the broader goals of poverty eradication and sustainable development, recognising that effective responses to climate change require a global collective effort that may be guided by the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. {1.1.1}

Climate adaptation refers to the actions taken to manage impacts of climate change by reducing vulnerability and exposure to its harmful effects and exploiting any potential benefits. Adaptation takes place at international, national and local levels. Subnational jurisdictions and entities, including urban and rural municipalities, are key to developing and reinforcing measures for reducing weather- and climate-related risks. Adaptation implementation faces several barriers including lack of up-to-date and locally relevant information, lack of finance and technology, social values and attitudes, and institutional constraints (high confidence). Adaptation is more likely to contribute to sustainable development when policies align with mitigation and poverty eradication goals (medium confidence). {1.1, 1.4}

Ambitious mitigation actions are indispensable to limit warming to 1.5°C while achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication (high confidence). Ill-designed responses, however, could pose challenges especially – but not exclusively – for countries and regions contending with poverty and those requiring significant transformation of their energy systems. This report focuses on ‘climate-resilient development pathways’, which aim to meet the goals of sustainable development, including climate adaptation and mitigation, poverty eradication and reducing inequalities. But any feasible pathway that remains within 1.5°C involves synergies and trade-offs (high confidence). Significant uncertainty remains as to which pathways are more consistent with the principle of equity.
{1.1.1, 1.4}

Multiple forms of knowledge, including scientific evidence, narrative scenarios and prospective pathways, inform the understanding of 1.5°C. This report is informed by traditional evidence of the physical climate system and associated impacts and vulnerabilities of climate change, together with knowledge drawn from the perceptions of risk and the experiences of climate impacts and governance systems. Scenarios and pathways are used to explore conditions enabling goal-oriented futures while recognizing the significance of ethical considerations, the principle of equity, and the societal transformation needed. {1.2.3, 1.5.2}

There is no single answer to the question of whether it is feasible to limit warming to 1.5°C and adapt to the consequences. Feasibility is considered in this report as the capacity of a system as a whole to achieve a specific outcome. The global transformation that would be needed to limit warming to 1.5°C requires enabling conditions that reflect the links, synergies and trade-offs between mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development. These enabling conditions are assessed across many dimensions of feasibility – geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional – that may be considered through the unifying lens of the Anthropocene, acknowledging profound, differential but increasingly geologically significant human influences on the Earth system as a whole. This framing also emphasises the global interconnectivity of past, present and future human–environment relations, highlighting the need and opportunities for integrated responses to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. {1.1, Cross-Chapter Box 1}

The human fingerprint on global warming was likely evident in Earth’s atmosphere far earlier than previously thought—even before the invention of modern cars, a new study says.

Using a combination of scientific theory, modern observations and multiple, sophisticated computer models, researchers found a clear signal of human-caused climate change was likely discernible with high confidence as early as 1885, just before the advent of gas-powered cars but after the dawn of the industrial revolution.

The findings, detailed in a paper published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, raise the likelihood that humanity has been remaking the planet’s climate in a detectable way for longer than previously believed—and highlight the importance of tracking changes in the upper atmosphere.

Scientists had begun to record surface temperature observations by the mid-19th century. The start date for a detectable human signal in surface temperatures has generally been thought to be in the early-to-mid-20th century, though other parts of the climate system showed signs of change at different times.

For this study, the veteran climate researchers posed the question: With the observational tools of today, when is the earliest that the signs of human-caused climate change would have been detectable in the atmosphere?

The study looked specifically at signals in the stratosphere – the second level of the atmosphere. Most weather occurs in the lowest level, the troposphere. While greenhouse gas emissions warm the lower atmosphere, they exert the opposite effect on the stratosphere, particularly its upper regions.


Researchers used this knowledge to examine climate models looking back in time for signs of these effects.

The findings surprised lead author Ben Santer and co-author Susan Solomon, who did not expect to find such a clear human signal in the upper atmosphere so early in the climate record.

“It was surprising, really surprising to me the answer that we could have identified with high confidence a human-caused stratospheric cooling signal within 25 years of the start of monitoring, if we had back then in 1860 the measuring capability that we have today,” Santer, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said.

The signal of climate change was detectable in the 19th-century atmosphere after just a 10 parts per million increase in carbon dioxide concentrations in the 40 years between 1860 and 1899. For comparison, planet-warming carbon dioxide levels skyrocketed by about 50 parts per million between 2000 and 2025, Santer said.


Overall, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased by about 140 parts per million since the initially detectible point the scientists pinpointed.

“The results show it would have been detectable very quickly,” said Gabi Hegerl of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the new paper. “This highlights the strong influence that greenhouse gas increases have on the upper atmosphere compared to the variability there.”

Andrea Steiner, a climate scientist at the Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change at the University of Graz in Austria, told CNN the study shows human-caused climate change can be detected earlier in the atmosphere than at the surface.

“This confirms that temperature change signals of the atmosphere are effective not only for detection, but also as early indicators of the success of climate mitigation efforts,” she said. Steiner was not involved in the new study.

Continued observations are key
Both Santer and Solomon emphasized the results show the importance of continuing to closely monitor the upper atmosphere.


That message comes at a time of steep scientific budget cuts, when crucial climate satellites and research programs are being targeted. This is particularly the case in the NOAA, NASA and Department of Energy budget proposals, Santer noted.

The NOAA budget proposal, for example, would eliminate the air and oceans agency’s research division, which includes carbon dioxide monitoring functions. In addition, the Trump administration’s NASA budget proposal would cut some climate-relevant satellite missions, while stripping future NOAA satellites of climate science sensors.

“I do think it’s important for non-scientists to know what’s at stake here. That when we lose the capability to measure and monitor how our world is changing, it makes us all less safe,” Santer said.

According to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.

The 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means “difference from average”) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015–2024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.

Why global surface temperature matters

The global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth’s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth’s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth’s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.

Given the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth’s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.

Beyond being an indicator of changes in Earth’s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.

About surface temperature

The concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the "average" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.

To calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies—the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.

Across inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships—such as the way temperature decreases with altitude—to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.

Past and future change in global temperature

Temperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but  more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.

global warming, the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near the surface of Earth over the past one to two centuries. Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered detailed observations of various weather phenomena (such as temperatures, precipitation, and storms) and of related influences on climate (such as ocean currents and the atmosphere’s chemical composition). These data indicate that Earth’s climate has changed over almost every conceivable timescale since the beginning of geologic time and that human activities since at least the beginning of the Industrial Revolution have a growing influence over the pace and extent of present-day climate change.


Giving voice to a growing conviction of most of the scientific community, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was formed in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), published in 2021, noted that the best estimate of the increase in global average surface temperature between 1850 and 2019 was 1.07 °C (1.9 °F). An IPCC special report produced in 2018 noted that human beings and their activities have been responsible for a worldwide average temperature increase between 0.8 and 1.2 °C (1.4 and 2.2 °F) since preindustrial times, and most of the warming over the second half of the 20th century could be attributed to human activities.



AR6 produced a series of global climate predictions based on modeling five greenhouse gas emission scenarios that accounted for future emissions, mitigation (severity reduction) measures, and uncertainties in the model projections. Some of the main uncertainties include the precise role of feedback processes and the impacts of industrial pollutants known as aerosols, which may offset some warming. The lowest-emissions scenario, which assumed steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2015, predicted that the global mean surface temperature would increase between 1.0 and 1.8 °C (1.8 and 3.2 °F) by 2100 relative to the 1850–1900 average. This range stood in stark contrast to the highest-emissions scenario, which predicted that the mean surface temperature would rise between 3.3 and 5.7 °C (5.9 and 10.2 °F) by 2100 based on the assumption that greenhouse gas emissions would continue to increase throughout the 21st century. The intermediate-emissions scenario, which assumed that emissions would stabilize by 2050 before declining gradually, projected an increase of between 2.1 and 3.5 °C (3.8 and 6.3 °F) by 2100.



Many climate scientists agree that significant societal, economic, and ecological damage would result if the global average temperature rose by more than 2 °C (3.6 °F) in such a short time. Such damage would include increased extinction of many plant and animal species, shifts in patterns of agriculture, and rising sea levels. By 2015 all but a few national governments had begun the process of instituting carbon reduction plans as part of the Paris Agreement, a treaty designed to help countries keep global warming to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) above preindustrial levels in order to avoid the worst of the predicted effects. Whereas authors of the 2018 special report noted that should carbon emissions continue at their present rate, the increase in average near-surface air temperature would reach 1.5 °C sometime between 2030 and 2052, authors of the AR6 report suggested that this threshold would be reached by 2041 at the latest. In an ominous sign that the long-term temperature threshold of 1.5 °C could arrive far sooner than expected, global climate monitoring databases reported that the global temperature average for the year 2024 was 1.6 °C above preindustrial levels.



The AR6 report also noted that the global average sea level had risen by some 20 cm (7.9 inches) between 1901 and 2018 and that sea level rose faster in the second half of the 20th century than in the first half. It also predicted, again depending on a wide range of scenarios, that the global average sea level would rise by different amounts by 2100 relative to the 1995–2014 average. Under the report’s lowest-emission scenario, sea level would rise by 28–55 cm (11–21.7 inches), whereas, under the intermediate emissions scenario, sea level would rise by 44–76 cm (17.3–29.9 inches). The highest-emissions scenario suggested that sea level would rise by 63–101 cm (24.8–39.8 inches) by 2100.

greenhouse effect on Earth

greenhouse effect on EarthThe greenhouse effect on Earth. Some incoming sunlight is reflected by Earth's atmosphere and surface, but most is absorbed by the surface, which is warmed. Infrared (IR) radiation is then emitted from the surface. Some IR radiation escapes to space, but some is absorbed by the atmosphere's greenhouse gases (especially water vapour, carbon dioxide, and methane) and reradiated in all directions, some to space and some back toward the surface, where it further warms the surface and the lower atmosphere.
(more)
The scenarios referred to above depend mainly on future concentrations of certain trace gases, called greenhouse gases, that have been injected into the lower atmosphere in increasing amounts through the burning of fossil fuels for industry, transportation, and residential uses. Modern global warming is the result of an increase in magnitude of the so-called greenhouse effect, a warming of Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere caused by the presence of water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, and other greenhouse gases. In 2014 the IPCC first reported that concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides in the atmosphere surpassed those found in ice cores dating back 800,000 years.

Of all these gases, carbon dioxide is the most important, both for its role in the greenhouse effect and for its role in the human economy. It has been estimated that, at the beginning of the industrial age in the mid-18th century, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were roughly 280 parts per million (ppm). By the end of 2022 they had risen to 419 ppm, and, if fossil fuels continue to be burned at current rates, they are projected to reach 550 ppm by the mid-21st century—essentially, a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in 300 years.

Climatic variation since the last glaciation

Global warming is related to the more general phenomenon of climate change, which refers to changes in the totality of attributes that define climate. In addition to changes in air temperature, climate change involves changes to precipitation patterns, winds, ocean currents, and other measures of Earth’s climate. Normally, climate change can be viewed as the combination of various natural forces occurring over diverse timescales. Since the advent of human civilization, climate change has involved an “anthropogenic,” or exclusively human-caused, element, and this anthropogenic element has become more important in the industrial period of the past two centuries. The term global warming is used specifically to refer to any warming of near-surface air during the past two centuries that can be traced to anthropogenic causes.

To define the concepts of global warming and climate change properly, it is first necessary to recognize that the climate of Earth has varied across many timescales, ranging from an individual human life span to billions of years. This variable climate history is typically classified in terms of “regimes” or “epochs.” For instance, the Pleistocene glacial epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) was marked by substantial variations in the global extent of glaciers and ice sheets. These variations took place on timescales of tens to hundreds of millennia and were driven by changes in the distribution of solar radiation across Earth’s surface. The distribution of solar radiation is known as the insolation pattern, and it is strongly affected by the geometry of Earth’s orbit around the Sun and by the orientation, or tilt, of Earth’s axis relative to the direct rays of the Sun.

Worldwide, the most recent glacial period, or ice age, culminated about 21,000 years ago in what is often called the Last Glacial Maximum. During this time, continental ice sheets extended well into the middle latitude regions of Europe and North America, reaching as far south as present-day London and New York City. Global annual mean temperature appears to have been about 4–5 °C (7–9 °F) colder than in the mid-20th century. It is important to remember that these figures are a global average. In fact, during the height of this last ice age, Earth’s climate was characterized by greater cooling at higher latitudes (that is, toward the poles) and relatively little cooling over large parts of the tropical oceans (near the Equator). This glacial interval terminated abruptly about 11,700 years ago and was followed by the subsequent relatively ice-free period known as the Holocene Epoch. The modern period of Earth’s history is conventionally defined as residing within the Holocene. However, some scientists have argued that the Holocene Epoch terminated in the relatively recent past and that Earth currently resides in a climatic interval that could justly be called the Anthropocene Epoch—that is, a period during which humans have exerted a dominant influence over climate.

Though less dramatic than the climate changes that occurred during the Pleistocene Epoch, significant variations in global climate have nonetheless taken place over the course of the Holocene. During the early Holocene, roughly 9,000 years ago, atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns appear to have been substantially different from those of today. For example, there is evidence for relatively wet conditions in what is now the Sahara Desert. The change from one climatic regime to another was caused by only modest changes in the pattern of insolation within the Holocene interval as well as the interaction of these patterns with large-scale climate phenomena such as monsoons and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

During the middle Holocene, some 5,000–7,000 years ago, conditions appear to have been relatively warm—indeed, perhaps warmer than today in some parts of the world and during certain seasons. For this reason, this interval is sometimes referred to as the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum. The relative warmth of average near-surface air temperatures at this time, however, is somewhat unclear. Changes in the pattern of insolation favoured warmer summers at higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, but these changes also produced cooler winters in the Northern Hemisphere and relatively cool conditions year-round in the tropics. Any overall hemispheric or global mean temperature changes thus reflected a balance between competing seasonal and regional changes. In fact, recent theoretical climate model studies suggest that global mean temperatures during the middle Holocene were probably 0.2–0.3 °C (0.4–0.5 °F) colder than average late 20th-century conditions.

Over subsequent millennia, conditions appear to have cooled relative to middle Holocene levels. This period has sometimes been referred to as the “Neoglacial.” In the middle latitudes this cooling trend was associated with intermittent periods of advancing and retreating mountain glaciers reminiscent of (though far more modest than) the more substantial advance and retreat of the major continental ice sheets of the Pleistocene climate epoch.
Causes of global warming

The greenhouse effect

The average surface temperature of Earth is maintained by a balance of various forms of solar and terrestrial radiation. Solar radiation is often called “shortwave” radiation because the frequencies of the radiation are relatively high and the wavelengths relatively short—close to the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Terrestrial radiation, on the other hand, is often called “longwave” radiation because the frequencies are relatively low and the wavelengths relatively long—somewhere in the infrared part of the spectrum. Downward-moving solar energy is typically measured in watts per square metre. The energy of the total incoming solar radiation at the top of Earth’s atmosphere (the so-called “solar constant”) amounts roughly to 1,366 watts per square metre annually. Adjusting for the fact that only one-half of the planet’s surface receives solar radiation at any given time, the average surface insolation is 342 watts per square metre annually.

The amount of solar radiation absorbed by Earth’s surface is only a small fraction of the total solar radiation entering the atmosphere. For every 100 units of incoming solar radiation, roughly 30 units are reflected back to space by either clouds, the atmosphere, or reflective regions of Earth’s surface. This reflective capacity is referred to as Earth’s planetary albedo, and it need not remain fixed over time, since the spatial extent and distribution of reflective formations, such as clouds and ice cover, can change. The 70 units of solar radiation that are not reflected may be absorbed by the atmosphere, clouds, or the surface. In the absence of further complications, in order to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium, Earth’s surface and atmosphere must radiate these same 70 units back to space. Earth’s surface temperature (and that of the lower layer of the atmosphere essentially in contact with the surface) is tied to the magnitude of this emission of outgoing radiation according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Earth’s energy budget is further complicated by the greenhouse effect. Trace gases with certain chemical properties—the so-called greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)—absorb some of the infrared radiation produced by Earth’s surface. Because of this absorption, some fraction of the original 70 units does not directly escape to space. Because greenhouse gases emit the same amount of radiation they absorb and because this radiation is emitted equally in all directions (that is, as much downward as upward), the net effect of absorption by greenhouse gases is to increase the total amount of radiation emitted downward toward Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere. To maintain equilibrium, Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere must emit more radiation than the original 70 units. Consequently, the surface temperature must be higher. This process is not quite the same as that which governs a true greenhouse, but the end effect is similar. The presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leads to a warming of the surface and lower part of the atmosphere (and a cooling higher up in the atmosphere) relative to what would be expected in the absence of greenhouse gases.

It is essential to distinguish the “natural,” or background, greenhouse effect from the “enhanced” greenhouse effect associated with human activity. The natural greenhouse effect is associated with surface warming properties of natural constituents of Earth’s atmosphere, especially water vapour, carbon dioxide, and methane. The existence of this effect is accepted by all scientists. Indeed, in its absence, Earth’s average temperature would be approximately 33 °C (59 °F) colder than today, and Earth would be a frozen and likely uninhabitable planet. What has been subject to controversy is the so-called enhanced greenhouse effect, which is associated with increased concentrations of greenhouse gases caused by human activity. In particular, the burning of fossil fuels raises the concentrations of the major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and these higher concentrations have the potential to warm the atmosphere by several degrees.

Radiative forcing

global mean radiative forcings since 1750

global mean radiative forcings since 1750Since 1750 the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases has increased in Earth's atmosphere. As a result of these and other factors, Earth's atmosphere retains more heat than in the past.
(more)
In light of the discussion above of the greenhouse effect, it is apparent that the temperature of Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere may be modified in three ways: (1) through a net increase in the solar radiation entering at the top of Earth’s atmosphere, (2) through a change in the fraction of the radiation reaching the surface, and (3) through a change in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In each case the changes can be thought of in terms of “radiative forcing.” As defined by the IPCC, radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a given climatic factor has on the amount of downward-directed radiant energy impinging upon Earth’s surface. Climatic factors are divided between those caused primarily by human activity (such as greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol emissions) and those caused by natural forces (such as solar irradiance); then, for each factor, so-called forcing values are calculated for the time period between 1750 and the present day. “Positive forcing” is exerted by climatic factors that contribute to the warming of Earth’s surface, whereas “negative forcing” is exerted by factors that cool Earth’s surface.


On average, about 342 watts of solar radiation strike each square metre of Earth’s surface, and this quantity can in turn be related to a rise or fall in Earth’s surface temperature. Temperatures at the surface may also rise or fall through a change in the distribution of terrestrial radiation (that is, radiation emitted by Earth) within the atmosphere. In some cases, radiative forcing has a natural origin, such as during explosive eruptions from volcanoes where vented gases and ash block some portion of solar radiation from the surface. In other cases, radiative forcing has an anthropogenic, or exclusively human, origin. For example, anthropogenic increases in carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, halogenated gases, and other factors are estimated to account for 2.72 watts per square metre of positive radiative forcing, relative to estimated 1750 benchmark values. When all values of positive and negative radiative forcing are taken together and all interactions between climatic factors are accounted for, the total net increase in surface radiation due to human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution is 1.6 watts per square metre.

Human activity has influenced global surface temperatures by changing the radiative balance governing the Earth on various timescales and at varying spatial scales. The most profound and well-known anthropogenic influence is the elevation of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Humans also influence climate by changing the concentrations of aerosols and ozone and by modifying the land cover of Earth’s surface.
Greenhouse gases

greenhouse gas emissions

greenhouse gas emissionsFactories that burn fossil fuels help to cause global warming.
As discussed above, greenhouse gases warm Earth’s surface by increasing the net downward longwave radiation reaching the surface. The relationship between atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and the associated positive radiative forcing of the surface is different for each gas. A complicated relationship exists between the chemical properties of each greenhouse gas and the relative amount of longwave radiation that each can absorb. What follows is a discussion of the radiative behaviour of each major greenhouse gas.
Water vapour

surface hydrologic cycle

surface hydrologic cycleThe present-day surface hydrologic cycle, in which water is transferred from the oceans through the atmosphere to the continents and back to the oceans over and beneath the land surface. The values in parentheses following the various forms of water (e.g., ice) refer to volumes in millions of cubic kilometres; those following the processes (e.g., precipitation) refer to their fluxes in millions of cubic kilometres of water per year.

Water vapour is the most potent of the greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere, but its behaviour is fundamentally different from that of the other greenhouse gases. The primary role of water vapour is not as a direct agent of radiative forcing but rather as a climate feedback—that is, as a response within the climate system that influences the system’s continued activity (see below Water vapour feedback). This distinction arises from the fact that the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere cannot, in general, be directly modified by human behaviour but is instead set by air temperatures. The warmer the surface, the greater the evaporation rate of water from the surface. As a result, increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapour in the lower atmosphere capable of absorbing longwave radiation and emitting it downward.

global warming, the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near the surface of Earth over the past one to two centuries. Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered detailed observations of various weather phenomena (such as temperatures, precipitation, and storms) and of related influences on climate (such as ocean currents and the atmosphere’s chemical composition).

During this time, continental ice sheets extended well into the middle latitude regions of Europe and North America, reaching as far south as present-day London and New York City. Global annual mean temperature appears to have been about 4–5 °C (7–9 °F) colder than in the mid-20th century. It is important to remember that these figures are a global average. In fact, during the height of this last ice age, Earth’s climate was characterized by greater cooling at higher latitudes (that is, toward the poles) and relatively little cooling over large parts of the tropical oceans (near the Equator). This glacial interval terminated abruptly about 11,700 years ago and was followed by the subsequent relatively ice-free period known as the Holocene Epoch. The modern period of Earth’s history is conventionally defined as residing within the Holocene. However, some scientists have argued that the Holocene Epoch terminated in the relatively recent past and that Earth currently resides in a climatic interval that could justly be called the Anthropocene Epoch—that is, a period during which humans have exerted a dominant influence over climate.

Though less dramatic than the climate changes that occurred during the Pleistocene Epoch, significant variations in global climate have nonetheless taken place over the course of the Holocene. During the early Holocene, roughly 9,000 years ago, atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns appear to have been substantially different from those of today. For example, there is evidence for relatively wet conditions in what is now the Sahara Desert. The change from one climatic regime to another was caused by only modest changes in the pattern of insolation within the Holocene interval as well as the interaction of these patterns with large-scale climate phenomena such as monsoons and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

During the middle Holocene, some 5,000–7,000 years ago, conditions appear to have been relatively warm—indeed, perhaps warmer than today in some parts of the world and during certain seasons. For this reason, this interval is sometimes referred to as the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum. The relative warmth of average near-surface air temperatures at this time, however, is somewhat unclear. Changes in the pattern of insolation favoured warmer summers at higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, but these changes also produced cooler winters in the Northern Hemisphere and relatively cool conditions year-round in the tropics. Any overall hemispheric or global mean temperature changes thus reflected a balance between competing seasonal and regional changes. In fact, recent theoretical climate model studies suggest that global mean temperatures during the middle Holocene were probably 0.2–0.3 °C (0.4–0.5 °F) colder than average late 20th-century conditions.

Over subsequent millennia, conditions appear to have cooled relative to middle Holocene levels. This period has sometimes been referred to as the “Neoglacial.” In the middle latitudes this cooling trend was associated with intermittent periods of advancing and retreating mountain glaciers reminiscent of (though far more modest than) the more substantial advance and retreat of the major continental ice sheets of the Pleistocene climate epoch.
Causes of global warming

The greenhouse effect

The average surface temperature of Earth is maintained by a balance of various forms of solar and terrestrial radiation. Solar radiation is often called “shortwave” radiation because the frequencies of the radiation are relatively high and the wavelengths relatively short—close to the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Terrestrial radiation, on the other hand, is often called “longwave” radiation because the frequencies are relatively low and the wavelengths relatively long—somewhere in the infrared part of the spectrum. Downward-moving solar energy is typically measured in watts per square metre. The energy of the total incoming solar radiation at the top of Earth’s atmosphere (the so-called “solar constant”) amounts roughly to 1,366 watts per square metre annually. Adjusting for the fact that only one-half of the planet’s surface receives solar radiation at any given time, the average surface insolation is 342 watts per square metre annually.

The amount of solar radiation absorbed by Earth’s surface is only a small fraction of the total solar radiation entering the atmosphere. For every 100 units of incoming solar radiation, roughly 30 units are reflected back to space by either clouds, the atmosphere, or reflective regions of Earth’s surface. This reflective capacity is referred to as Earth’s planetary albedo, and it need not remain fixed over time, since the spatial extent and distribution of reflective formations, such as clouds and ice cover, can change. The 70 units of solar radiation that are not reflected may be absorbed by the atmosphere, clouds, or the surface. In the absence of further complications, in order to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium, Earth’s surface and atmosphere must radiate these same 70 units back to space. Earth’s surface temperature (and that of the lower layer of the atmosphere essentially in contact with the surface) is tied to the magnitude of this emission of outgoing radiation according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Earth’s energy budget is further complicated by the greenhouse effect. Trace gases with certain chemical properties—the so-called greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)—absorb some of the infrared radiation produced by Earth’s surface. Because of this absorption, some fraction of the original 70 units does not directly escape to space. Because greenhouse gases emit the same amount of radiation they absorb and because this radiation is emitted equally in all directions (that is, as much downward as upward), the net effect of absorption by greenhouse gases is to increase the total amount of radiation emitted downward toward Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere. To maintain equilibrium, Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere must emit more radiation than the original 70 units. Consequently, the surface temperature must be higher. This process is not quite the same as that which governs a true greenhouse, but the end effect is similar. The presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leads to a warming of the surface and lower part of the atmosphere (and a cooling higher up in the atmosphere) relative to what would be expected in the absence of greenhouse gases.

It is essential to distinguish the “natural,” or background, greenhouse effect from the “enhanced” greenhouse effect associated with human activity. The natural greenhouse effect is associated with surface warming properties of natural constituents of Earth’s atmosphere, especially water vapour, carbon dioxide, and methane. The existence of this effect is accepted by all scientists. Indeed, in its absence, Earth’s average temperature would be approximately 33 °C (59 °F) colder than today, and Earth would be a frozen and likely uninhabitable planet. What has been subject to controversy is the so-called enhanced greenhouse effect, which is associated with increased concentrations of greenhouse gases caused by human activity. In particular, the burning of fossil fuels raises the concentrations of the major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and these higher concentrations have the potential to warm the atmosphere by several degrees.

Radiative forcing

global mean radiative forcings since 1750

global mean radiative forcings since 1750Since 1750 the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases has increased in Earth's atmosphere. As a result of these and other factors, Earth's atmosphere retains more heat than in the past.

In light of the discussion above of the greenhouse effect, it is apparent that the temperature of Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere may be modified in three ways: (1) through a net increase in the solar radiation entering at the top of Earth’s atmosphere, (2) through a change in the fraction of the radiation reaching the surface, and (3) through a change in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In each case the changes can be thought of in terms of “radiative forcing.” As defined by the IPCC, radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a given climatic factor has on the amount of downward-directed radiant energy impinging upon Earth’s surface. Climatic factors are divided between those caused primarily by human activity (such as greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol emissions) and those caused by natural forces (such as solar irradiance); then, for each factor, so-called forcing values are calculated for the time period between 1750 and the present day. “Positive forcing” is exerted by climatic factors that contribute to the warming of Earth’s surface, whereas “negative forcing” is exerted by factors that cool Earth’s surface.


On average, about 342 watts of solar radiation strike each square metre of Earth’s surface, and this quantity can in turn be related to a rise or fall in Earth’s surface temperature. Temperatures at the surface may also rise or fall through a change in the distribution of terrestrial radiation (that is, radiation emitted by Earth) within the atmosphere. In some cases, radiative forcing has a natural origin, such as during explosive eruptions from volcanoes where vented gases and ash block some portion of solar radiation from the surface. In other cases, radiative forcing has an anthropogenic, or exclusively human, origin. For example, anthropogenic increases in carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, halogenated gases, and other factors are estimated to account for 2.72 watts per square metre of positive radiative forcing, relative to estimated 1750 benchmark values. When all values of positive and negative radiative forcing are taken together and all interactions between climatic factors are accounted for, the total net increase in surface radiation due to human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution is 1.6 watts per square metre.

Human activity has influenced global surface temperatures by changing the radiative balance governing the Earth on various timescales and at varying spatial scales. The most profound and well-known anthropogenic influence is the elevation of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Humans also influence climate by changing the concentrations of aerosols and ozone and by modifying the land cover of Earth’s surface.
Greenhouse gases

greenhouse gas emissions

greenhouse gas emissionsFactories that burn fossil fuels help to cause global warming.
As discussed above, greenhouse gases warm Earth’s surface by increasing the net downward longwave radiation reaching the surface. The relationship between atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and the associated positive radiative forcing of the surface is different for each gas. A complicated relationship exists between the chemical properties of each greenhouse gas and the relative amount of longwave radiation that each can absorb. What follows is a discussion of the radiative behaviour of each major greenhouse gas.
Water vapour

surface hydrologic cycle

The values in parentheses following the various forms of water (e.g., ice) refer to volumes in millions of cubic kilometres; those following the processes (e.g., precipitation) refer to their fluxes in millions of cubic kilometres of water per year.

Water vapour is the most potent of the greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere, but its behaviour is fundamentally different from that of the other greenhouse gases. The primary role of water vapour is not as a direct agent of radiative forcing but rather as a climate feedback—that is, as a response within the climate system that influences the system’s continued activity (see below Water vapour feedback). This distinction arises from the fact that the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere cannot, in general, be directly modified by human behaviour but is instead set by air temperatures. The warmer the surface, the greater the evaporation rate of water from the surface. As a result, increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapour in the lower atmosphere capable of absorbing longwave radiation and emitting it downward.

Carbon dioxide

carbon cycle

carbon cycleCarbon is transported in various forms through the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and geologic formations. One of the primary pathways for the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) takes place between the atmosphere and the oceans; there a fraction of the CO2 combines with water, forming carbonic acid (H2CO3) that subsequently loses hydrogen ions (H+) to form bicarbonate (HCO3−) and carbonate (CO32−) ions. Mollusk shells or mineral precipitates that form by the reaction of calcium or other metal ions with carbonate may become buried in geologic strata and eventually release CO2 through volcanic outgassing. Carbon dioxide also exchanges through photosynthesis in plants and through respiration in animals. Dead and decaying organic matter may ferment and release CO2 or methane (CH4) or may be incorporated into sedimentary rock, where it is converted to fossil fuels. Burning of hydrocarbon fuels returns CO2 and water (H2O) to the atmosphere. The biological and anthropogenic pathways are much faster than the geochemical pathways and, consequently, have a greater impact on the composition and temperature of the atmosphere.

Awareness and a partial understanding of most of the
interactive processes in the Earth system that govern climate
and climate change predate the IPCC, often by many decades. A
deeper understanding and quantifi cation of these processes and
their incorporation in climate models have progressed rapidly
since the IPCC First Assessment Report in 1990.
As climate science and the Earth’s climate have continued
to evolve over recent decades, increasing evidence of
anthropogenic infl uences on climate change has been found.
Correspondingly, the IPCC has made increasingly more
defi nitive statements about human impacts on climate.
Debate has stimulated a wide variety of climate change
research. The results of this research have refi ned but not
signifi cantly redirected the main scientifi c conclusions from the
sequence of IPCC assessments.
1.1 Overview of the Chapter
To better understand the science assessed in this Fourth
Assessment Report (AR4), it is helpful to review the long
historical perspective that has led to the current state of
climate change knowledge. This chapter starts by describing
the fundamental nature of earth science. It then describes the
history of climate change science using a wide-ranging subset
of examples, and ends with a history of the IPCC.
The concept of this chapter is new. There is no counterpart in
previous IPCC assessment reports for an introductory chapter
providing historical context for the remainder of the report.
Here, a restricted set of topics has been selected to illustrate
key accomplishments and challenges in climate change science.
The topics have been chosen for their signifi cance to the IPCC
task of assessing information relevant for understanding the
risks of human-induced climate change, and also to illustrate
the complex and uneven pace of scientifi c progress.
In this chapter, the time frame under consideration stops with
the publication of the Third Assessment Report (TAR; IPCC,
2001a). Developments subsequent to the TAR are described in
the other chapters of this report, and we refer to these chapters
throughout this fi rst chapter.
1.2 The Nature of Earth Science
Science may be stimulated by argument and debate, but it
generally advances through formulating hypotheses clearly and
testing them objectively. This testing is the key to science. In
fact, one philosopher of science insisted that to be genuinely
scientifi c, a statement must be susceptible to testing that could
potentially show it to be false (Popper, 1934). In practice,
contemporary scientists usually submit their research fi ndings
to the scrutiny of their peers, which includes disclosing the
methods that they use, so their results can be checked through
replication by other scientists. The insights and research results
of individual scientists, even scientists of unquestioned genius,
are thus confi rmed or rejected in the peer-reviewed literature
by the combined efforts of many other scientists. It is not the
belief or opinion of the scientists that is important, but rather
the results of this testing. Indeed, when Albert Einstein was
informed of the publication of a book entitled 100 Authors
Against Einstein, he is said to have remarked, ‘If I were wrong,
then one would have been enough!’ (Hawking, 1988); however,
that one opposing scientist would have needed proof in the form
of testable results.
Thus science is inherently self-correcting; incorrect or
incomplete scientifi c concepts ultimately do not survive repeated
testing against observations of nature. Scientifi c theories are
ways of explaining phenomena and providing insights that
can be evaluated by comparison with physical reality. Each
successful prediction adds to the weight of evidence supporting
the theory, and any unsuccessful prediction demonstrates that
the underlying theory is imperfect and requires improvement or
abandonment. Sometimes, only certain kinds of questions tend
to be asked about a scientifi c phenomenon until contradictions
build to a point where a sudden change of paradigm takes
place (Kuhn, 1996). At that point, an entire fi eld can be rapidly
reconstructed under the new paradigm.
Despite occasional major paradigm shifts, the majority of
scientifi c insights, even unexpected insights, tend to emerge
incrementally as a result of repeated attempts to test hypotheses
as thoroughly as possible. Therefore, because almost every new
advance is based on the research and understanding that has
gone before, science is cumulative, with useful features retained
and non-useful features abandoned. Active research scientists,
throughout their careers, typically spend large fractions of their
working time studying in depth what other scientists have done.
Superfi cial or amateurish acquaintance with the current state of
a scientifi c research topic is an obstacle to a scientist’s progress.
Working scientists know that a day in the library can save a year
in the laboratory. Even Sir Isaac Newton (1675) wrote that if he
had ‘seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants’.
Intellectual honesty and professional ethics call for scientists to
acknowledge the work of predecessors and colleagues.
The attributes of science briefl y described here can be used
in assessing competing assertions about climate change. Can
the statement under consideration, in principle, be proven false?
Has it been rigorously tested? Did it appear in the peer-reviewed
literature? Did it build on the existing research record where
appropriate? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then
less credence should be given to the assertion until it is tested
and independently verifi ed. The IPCC assesses the scientifi c
literature to create a report based on the best available science
(Section 1.6). It must be acknowledged, however, that the IPCC
also contributes to science by identifying the key uncertainties
and by stimulating and coordinating targeted research to answer
important climate change questions.

Frequently Asked Question 1.1
What Factors Determine Earth’s Climate?
The climate system is a complex, interactive system consisting
of the atmosphere, land surface, snow and ice, oceans and other
bodies of water, and living things. The atmospheric component of
the climate system most obviously characterises climate; climate
is often defi ned as ‘average weather’. Climate is usually described
in terms of the mean and variability of temperature, precipitation
and wind over a period of time, ranging from months to millions
of years (the classical period is 30 years). The climate system
evolves in time under the infl uence of its own internal dynamics
and due to changes in external factors that affect climate (called
‘forcings’). External forcings include natural phenomena such as
volcanic eruptions and solar variations, as well as human-induced
changes in atmospheric composition. Solar radiation powers the
climate system. There are three fundamental ways to change the
radiation balance of the Earth: 1) by changing the incoming solar
radiation (e.g., by changes in Earth’s orbit or in the Sun itself); 2)
by changing the fraction of solar radiation that is refl ected (called
‘albedo’; e.g., by changes in cloud cover, atmospheric particles or
vegetation); and 3) by altering the longwave radiation from Earth
back towards space (e.g., by changing greenhouse gas concentra-
tions). Climate, in turn, responds directly to such changes, as well
as indirectly, through a variety of feedback mechanisms.
The amount of energy reaching the top of Earth’s atmosphere
each second on a surface area of one square metre facing the
Sun during daytime is about 1,370 Watts, and the amount of en-
ergy per square metre per second averaged over the entire planet
is one-quarter of this (see Figure 1). About 30% of the sunlight
that reaches the top of the atmosphere is refl ected back to space.
Roughly two-thirds of this refl ectivity is due to clouds and small
particles in the atmosphere known as ‘aerosols’. Light-coloured
areas of Earth’s surface – mainly snow, ice and deserts – refl ect the
remaining one-third of the sunlight. The most dramatic change in
aerosol-produced refl ectivity comes when major volcanic erup-
tions eject material very high into the atmosphere. Rain typically
(continued)
FAQ 1.1, Figure 1. Estimate of the Earth’s annual and global mean energy balance. Over the long term, the amount of incoming solar radiation absorbed by the Earth and
atmosphere is balanced by the Earth and atmosphere releasing the same amount of outgoing longwave radiation. About half of the incoming solar radiation is absorbed by the
Earth’s surface. This energy is transferred to the atmosphere by warming the air in contact with the surface (thermals), by evapotranspiration and by longwave radiation that is
absorbed by clouds and greenhouse gases. The atmosphere in turn radiates longwave energy back to Earth as well as out to space. Source: Kiehl and Trenberth (1997).

Chapter 1 clears aerosols out of the atmosphere in a week or two, but when
material from a violent volcanic eruption is projected far above
the highest cloud, these aerosols typically infl uence the climate
for about a year or two before falling into the troposphere and
being carried to the surface by precipitation. Major volcanic erup-
tions can thus cause a drop in mean global surface temperature of
about half a degree celsius that can last for months or even years.
Some man-made aerosols also signifi cantly refl ect sunlight.
The energy that is not refl ected back to space is absorbed by
the Earth’s surface and atmosphere. This amount is approximately
240 Watts per square metre (W m–2). To balance the incoming en-
ergy, the Earth itself must radiate, on average, the same amount
of energy back to space. The Earth does this by emitting outgoing
longwave radiation. Everything on Earth emits longwave radia-
tion continuously. That is the heat energy one feels radiating out
from a fi re; the warmer an object, the more heat energy it radi-
ates. To emit 240 W m–2, a surface would have to have a tem-
perature of around –19°C. This is much colder than the conditions
that actually exist at the Earth’s surface (the global mean surface
temperature is about 14°C). Instead, the necessary –19°C is found
at an altitude about 5 km above the surface.
The reason the Earth’s surface is this warm is the presence of
greenhouse gases, which act as a partial blanket for the longwave
radiation coming from the surface. This blanketing is known as
the natural greenhouse effect. The most important greenhouse
gases are water vapour and carbon dioxide. The two most abun-
dant constituents of the atmosphere – nitrogen and oxygen – have
no such effect. Clouds, on the other hand, do exert a blanketing
effect similar to that of the greenhouse gases; however, this effect
is offset by their refl ectivity, such that on average, clouds tend to
have a cooling effect on climate (although locally one can feel the
warming effect: cloudy nights tend to remain warmer than clear
nights because the clouds radiate longwave energy back down
to the surface). Human activities intensify the blanketing effect
through the release of greenhouse gases. For instance, the amount
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by about 35%
in the industrial era, and this increase is known to be due to hu-
man activities, primarily the combustion of fossil fuels and re-
moval of forests. Thus, humankind has dramatically altered the
chemical composition of the global atmosphere with substantial
implications for climate.
Because the Earth is a sphere, more solar energy arrives for a
given surface area in the tropics than at higher latitudes, where
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
sunlight strikes the atmosphere at a lower angle. Energy is trans-
ported from the equatorial areas to higher latitudes via atmo-
spheric and oceanic circulations, including storm systems. Energy
is also required to evaporate water from the sea or land surface,
and this energy, called latent heat, is released when water vapour
condenses in clouds (see Figure 1). Atmospheric circulation is pri-
marily driven by the release of this latent heat. Atmospheric cir-
culation in turn drives much of the ocean circulation through the
action of winds on the surface waters of the ocean, and through
changes in the ocean’s surface temperature and salinity through
precipitation and evaporation.
Due to the rotation of the Earth, the atmospheric circulation
patterns tend to be more east-west than north-south. Embedded
in the mid-latitude westerly winds are large-scale weather sys-
tems that act to transport heat toward the poles. These weather
systems are the familiar migrating low- and high-pressure sys-
tems and their associated cold and warm fronts. Because of land-
ocean temperature contrasts and obstacles such as mountain
ranges and ice sheets, the circulation system’s planetary-scale
atmospheric waves tend to be geographically anchored by conti-
nents and mountains although their amplitude can change with
time. Because of the wave patterns, a particularly cold winter
over North America may be associated with a particularly warm
winter elsewhere in the hemisphere. Changes in various aspects
of the climate system, such as the size of ice sheets, the type and
distribution of vegetation or the temperature of the atmosphere
or ocean will infl uence the large-scale circulation features of the
atmosphere and oceans.
There are many feedback mechanisms in the climate system
that can either amplify (‘positive feedback’) or diminish (‘negative
feedback’) the effects of a change in climate forcing. For example,
as rising concentrations of greenhouse gases warm Earth’s cli-
mate, snow and ice begin to melt. This melting reveals darker
land and water surfaces that were beneath the snow and ice,
and these darker surfaces absorb more of the Sun’s heat, causing
more warming, which causes more melting, and so on, in a self-
reinforcing cycle. This feedback loop, known as the ‘ice-albedo
feedback’, amplifi es the initial warming caused by rising levels
of greenhouse gases. Detecting, understanding and accurately
quantifying climate feedbacks have been the focus of a great deal
of research by scientists unravelling the complexities of Earth’s
climate.
97
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science A characteristic of Earth sciences is that Earth scientists are
unable to perform controlled experiments on the planet as a
whole and then observe the results. In this sense, Earth science
is similar to the disciplines of astronomy and cosmology that
cannot conduct experiments on galaxies or the cosmos. This
is an important consideration, because it is precisely such
whole-Earth, system-scale experiments, incorporating the full
complexity of interacting processes and feedbacks, that might
ideally be required to fully verify or falsify climate change
hypotheses (Schellnhuber et al., 2004). Nevertheless, countless
empirical tests of numerous different hypotheses have built
up a massive body of Earth science knowledge. This repeated
testing has refi ned the understanding of numerous aspects of the
climate system, from deep oceanic circulation to stratospheric
chemistry. Sometimes a combination of observations and models
can be used to test planetary-scale hypotheses. For example,
the global cooling and drying of the atmosphere observed after
the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo (Section 8.6) provided key tests
of particular aspects of global climate models (Hansen et al.,
1992).
Another example is provided by past IPCC projections
of future climate change compared to current observations.
Figure 1.1 reveals that the model projections of global average
temperature from the First Assessment Report (FAR; IPCC,
1990) were higher than those from the Second Assessment
Report (SAR; IPCC, 1996). Subsequent observations (Section
3.2) showed that the evolution of the actual climate system
fell midway between the FAR and the SAR ‘best estimate’
projections and were within or near the upper range of
projections from the TAR (IPCC, 2001a).
Not all theories or early results are verifi ed by later analysis.
In the mid-1970s, several articles about possible global cooling
appeared in the popular press, primarily motivated by analyses
indicating that Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperatures had
decreased during the previous three decades (e.g., Gwynne,
1975). In the peer-reviewed literature, a paper by Bryson
and Dittberner (1976) reported that increases in carbon
dioxide (CO2) should be associated with a decrease in global
temperatures. When challenged by Woronko (1977), Bryson and
Dittberner (1977) explained that the cooling projected by their
model was due to aerosols (small particles in the atmosphere)
produced by the same combustion that caused the increase in
CO2. However, because aerosols remain in the atmosphere only
a short time compared to CO2, the results were not applicable
for long-term climate change projections. This example of a
prediction of global cooling is a classic illustration of the self-
correcting nature of Earth science. The scientists involved were
reputable researchers who followed the accepted paradigm of
publishing in scientifi c journals, submitting their methods and
results to the scrutiny of their peers (although the peer-review
did not catch this problem), and responding to legitimate
criticism.
A recurring theme throughout this chapter is that climate
science in recent decades has been characterised by the

increasing rate of advancement of research in the fi eld and
by the notable evolution of scientifi c methodology and tools,
including the models and observations that support and enable
the research. During the last four decades, the rate at which
scientists have added to the body of knowledge of atmospheric
and oceanic processes has accelerated dramatically. As scientists
incrementally increase the totality of knowledge, they publish
their results in peer-reviewed journals. Between 1965 and 1995,
the number of articles published per year in atmospheric science
journals tripled (Geerts, 1999). Focusing more narrowly,
Stanhill (2001) found that the climate change science literature
grew approximately exponentially with a doubling time of 11
years for the period 1951 to 1997. Furthermore, 95% of all the
climate change science literature since 1834 was published
after 1951. Because science is cumulative, this represents
considerable growth in the knowledge of climate processes and
in the complexity of climate research. An important example
of this is the additional physics incorporated in climate models
over the last several decades, as illustrated in Figure 1.2. As a
result of the cumulative nature of science, climate science today
is an interdisciplinary synthesis of countless tested and proven
physical processes and principles painstakingly compiled
and verifi ed over several centuries of detailed laboratory
measurements, observational experiments and theoretical
analyses; and is now far more wide-ranging and physically
comprehensive than was the case only a few decades ago.

1.3.1 The Human Fingerprint on Greenhouse
Gases
The high-accuracy measurements of atmospheric CO2
concentration, initiated by Charles David Keeling in 1958,
constitute the master time series documenting the changing
composition of the atmosphere (Keeling, 1961, 1998). These
data have iconic status in climate change science as evidence of
the effect of human activities on the chemical composition of
the global atmosphere (see FAQ 7.1). Keeling’s measurements
on Mauna Loa in Hawaii provide a true measure of the global
carbon cycle, an effectively continuous record of the burning of
fossil fuel. They also maintain an accuracy and precision that
allow scientists to separate fossil fuel emissions from those due
to the natural annual cycle of the biosphere, demonstrating a
long-term change in the seasonal exchange of CO2 between
the atmosphere, biosphere and ocean. Later observations of
parallel trends in the atmospheric abundances of the 13CO2

(O2) (Keeling and Shertz, 1992; Bender et al., 1996) uniquely
identifi ed this rise in CO2 with fossil fuel burning (Sections 2.3,
7.1 and 7.3).
To place the increase in CO2 abundance since the late
1950s in perspective, and to compare the magnitude of the
anthropogenic increase with natural cycles in the past, a longer-
term record of CO2 and other natural greenhouse gases is
needed. These data came from analysis of the composition of air
enclosed in bubbles in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica.
The initial measurements demonstrated that CO2 abundances
were signifi cantly lower during the last ice age than over the
last 10 kyr of the Holocene (Delmas et al., 1980; Berner et al.,
1980; Neftel et al., 1982). From 10 kyr before present up to
the year 1750, CO2 abundances stayed within the range 280
± 20 ppm (Indermühle et al., 1999). During the industrial era,
CO2 abundance rose roughly exponentially to 367 ppm in 1999
(Neftel et al., 1985; Etheridge et al., 1996; IPCC, 2001a) and to
379 ppm in 2005 (Section 2.3.1; see also Section 6.4).
Direct atmospheric measurements since 1970 (Steele et al.,
1996) have also detected the increasing atmospheric abundances
of two other major greenhouse gases, methane (CH4) and nitrous
oxide (N2O). Methane abundances were initially increasing at a
rate of about 1% yr–1 (Graedel and McRae, 1980; Fraser et al.,
1981; Blake et al., 1982) but then slowed to an average increase
of 0.4% yr–1 over the 1990s (Dlugokencky et al., 1998) with the
possible stabilisation of CH4 abundance (Section 2.3.2). The
increase in N2O abundance is smaller, about 0.25% yr–1, and
more diffi cult to detect (Weiss, 1981; Khalil and Rasmussen,
1988). To go back in time, measurements were made from fi rn
air trapped in snowpack dating back over 200 years, and these
data show an accelerating rise in both CH4 and N2O into the
20th century (Machida et al., 1995; Battle et al., 1996). When
100
ice core measurements extended the CH4 abundance back
1 kyr, they showed a stable, relatively constant abundance of 700
ppb until the 19th century when a steady increase brought CH4
abundances to 1,745 ppb in 1998 (IPCC, 2001a) and 1,774 ppb
in 2005 (Section 2.3.2). This peak abundance is much higher than
the range of 400 to 700 ppb seen over the last half-million years
of glacial-interglacial cycles, and the increase can be readily
explained by anthropogenic emissions. For N2O the results are
similar: the relative increase over the industrial era is smaller
(15%), yet the 1998 abundance of 314 ppb (IPCC, 2001a), rising
to 319 ppb in 2005 (Section 2.3.3), is also well above the 180-
to-260 ppb range of glacial-interglacial cycles (Flückiger et al.,
1999; see Sections 2.3, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 7.1 and 7.4)
Several synthetic halocarbons (chlorofl uorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrofl uorocarbons, perfl uorocarbons, halons and sulphur
hexafl uoride) are greenhouse gases with large global warming
potentials (GWPs; Section 2.10). The chemical industry has
been producing these gases and they have been leaking into the
atmosphere since about 1930. Lovelock (1971) fi rst measured
CFC-11 (CFCl3) in the atmosphere, noting that it could serve as
an artifi cial tracer, with its north-south gradient refl ecting the
latitudinal distribution of anthropogenic emissions. Atmospheric
abundances of all the synthetic halocarbons were increasing
until the 1990s, when the abundance of halocarbons phased
out under the Montreal Protocol began to fall (Montzka et al.,
1999; Prinn et al., 2000). In the case of synthetic halocarbons
(except perfl uoromethane), ice core research has shown that
these compounds did not exist in ancient air (Langenfelds et
al., 1996) and thus confi rms their industrial human origin (see
Sections 2.3 and 7.1).
At the time of the TAR scientists could say that the abundances
of all the well-mixed greenhouse gases during the 1990s were
greater than at any time during the last half-million years (Petit
et al, 1999), and this record now extends back nearly one million
years (Section 6.3). Given this daunting picture of increasing
greenhouse gas abundances in the atmosphere, it is noteworthy
that, for simpler challenges but still on a hemispheric or even
global scale, humans have shown the ability to undo what they
have done. Sulphate pollution in Greenland was reversed in
the 1980s with the control of acid rain in North America and
Europe (IPCC, 2001b), and CFC abundances are declining
globally because of their phase-out undertaken to protect the
ozone layer.
1.3.2 Global Surface Temperature
Shortly after the invention of the thermometer in the early
1600s, efforts began to quantify and record the weather. The
fi rst meteorological network was formed in northern Italy in
1653 (Kington, 1988) and reports of temperature observations
were published in the earliest scientifi c journals (e.g., Wallis and
Beale, 1669). By the latter part of the 19th century, systematic
observations of the weather were being made in almost all
inhabited areas of the world. Formal international coordination
of meteorological observations from ships commenced in 1853
(Quetelet, 1854).
Chapter 1 Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
Inspired by the paper Suggestions
on a Uniform System of Meteorological
Observations (Buys-Ballot, 1872), the
International Meteorological Organization
(IMO) was formed in 1873. Its successor,
the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO), still works to promote and
exchange standardised meteorological
observations. Yet even with uniform
observations, there are still four major
obstacles to turning instrumental
observations into accurate global time
series: (1) access to the data in usable
form; (2) quality control to remove or edit
erroneous data points; (3) homogeneity
assessments and adjustments where
necessary to ensure the fi delity of the data;
and (4) area-averaging in the presence of
substantial gaps.
Köppen (1873, 1880, 1881) was the
fi rst scientist to overcome most of these
obstacles in his quest to study the effect of
changes in sunspots (Section 2.7). Much
of his data came from Dove (1852), but
wherever possible he used data directly from
the original source, because Dove often
lacked information about the observing
methods. Köppen considered examination
of the annual mean temperature to be an
adequate technique for quality control of far distant stations.
Using data from more than 100 stations, Köppen averaged
annual observations into several major latitude belts and then
area-averaged these into a near-global time series shown in
Figure 1.3.
Callendar (1938) produced the next global temperature
time series expressly to investigate the infl uence of CO2 on
temperature (Section 2.3). Callendar examined about 200
station records. Only a small portion of them were deemed
defective, based on quality concerns determined by comparing
differences with neighbouring stations or on homogeneity
concerns based on station changes documented in the recorded
metadata. After further removing two arctic stations because
he had no compensating stations from the antarctic region, he
created a global average using data from 147 stations.
Most of Callendar’s data came from World Weather Records
(WWR; Clayton, 1927). Initiated by a resolution at the 1923
IMO Conference, WWR was a monumental international
undertaking producing a 1,196-page volume of monthly
temperature, precipitation and pressure data from hundreds
of stations around the world, some with data starting in the
early 1800s. In the early 1960s, J. Wolbach had these data
digitised (National Climatic Data Center, 2002). The WWR
project continues today under the auspices of the WMO with
the digital publication of decadal updates to the climate records
for thousands of stations worldwide (National Climatic Data
Center, 2005).

and temperate latitudes using land air temperature. Callendar (1938) global using land stations. Willett
(1950) global using land stations. Callendar (1961) 60°N to 60°S using land stations. Mitchell (1963) global

(2006) global using land air temperature and sea surface temperature data is the longest of the currently
updated global temperature time series (Section 3.2). All time series were smoothed using a 13-point fi lter.
The Brohan et al. (2006) time series are anomalies from the 1961 to 1990 mean (°C). Each of the other time
series was originally presented as anomalies from the mean temperature of a specifi c and differing base
period. To make them comparable, the other time series have been adjusted to have the mean of their last
30 years identical to that same period in the Brohan et al. (2006) anomaly time series.
Willett (1950) also used WWR as the main source of data for
129 stations that he used to create a global temperature time series
going back to 1845. While the resolution that initiated WWR
called for the publication of long and homogeneous records,
Willett took this mandate one step further by carefully selecting
a subset of stations with as continuous and homogeneous a
record as possible from the most recent update of WWR, which
included data through 1940. To avoid over-weighting certain
areas such as Europe, only one record, the best available, was
included from each 10° latitude and longitude square. Station
monthly data were averaged into fi ve-year periods and then
converted to anomalies with respect to the fi ve-year period
1935 to 1939. Each station’s anomaly was given equal weight
to create the global time series.
Callendar in turn created a new near-global temperature
time series in 1961 and cited Willett (1950) as a guide for
some of his improvements. Callendar (1961) evaluated 600
stations with about three-quarters of them passing his quality
checks. Unbeknownst to Callendar, a former student of Willett,
Mitchell (1963), in work fi rst presented in 1961, had created
his own updated global temperature time series using slightly
fewer than 200 stations and averaging the data into latitude
bands. Landsberg and Mitchell (1961) compared Callendar’s
results with Mitchell’s and stated that there was generally good
agreement except in the data-sparse regions of the Southern
Hemisphere.
101
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science Meanwhile, research in Russia was proceeding on a very
different method to produce large-scale time series. Budyko
(1969) used smoothed, hand-drawn maps of monthly temperature
anomalies as a starting point. While restricted to analysis of the
NH, this map-based approach not only allowed the inclusion of
an increasing number of stations over time (e.g., 246 in 1881,
753 in 1913, 976 in 1940 and about 2,000 in 1960) but also the
utilisation of data over the oceans (Robock, 1982).
Increasing the number of stations utilised has been a
continuing theme over the last several decades with considerable
effort being spent digitising historical station data as well as
addressing the continuing problem of acquiring up-to-date data,
as there can be a long lag between making an observation and
the data getting into global data sets. During the 1970s and
1980s, several teams produced global temperature time series.
Advances especially worth noting during this period include the
extended spatial interpolation and station averaging technique
of Hansen and Lebedeff (1987) and the Jones et al. (1986a,b)
painstaking assessment of homogeneity and adjustments to
account for discontinuities in the record of each of the thousands
of stations in a global data set. Since then, global and national
data sets have been rigorously adjusted for homogeneity using
a variety of statistical and metadata-based approaches (Peterson
et al., 1998).
One recurring homogeneity concern is potential urban heat
island contamination in global temperature time series. This
concern has been addressed in two ways. The fi rst is by adjusting
the temperature of urban stations to account for assessed urban
heat island effects (e.g., Karl et al., 1988; Hansen et al., 2001).
The second is by performing analyses that, like Callendar
(1938), indicate that the bias induced by urban heat islands
in the global temperature time series is either minor or non-
existent (Jones et al., 1990; Peterson et al., 1999).
As the importance of ocean data became increasingly
recognised, a major effort was initiated to seek out, digitise
and quality-control historical archives of ocean data. This work
has since grown into the International Comprehensive Ocean-
Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS; Worley et al., 2005), which
has coordinated the acquisition, digitisation and synthesis of
data ranging from transmissions by Japanese merchant ships
to the logbooks of South African whaling boats. The amount
of sea surface temperature (SST) and related data acquired
continues to grow.
As fundamental as the basic data work of ICOADS was,
there have been two other major advances in SST data. The fi rst
was adjusting the early observations to make them comparable
to current observations (Section 3.2). Prior to 1940, the majority
of SST observations were made from ships by hauling a bucket
on deck fi lled with surface water and placing a thermometer in
it. This ancient method eventually gave way to thermometers
placed in engine cooling water inlets, which are typically
located several metres below the ocean surface. Folland and
Parker (1995) developed an adjustment model that accounted
for heat loss from the buckets and that varied with bucket size
and type, exposure to solar radiation, ambient wind speed and
ship speed. They verifi ed their results using time series of
102
Chapter 1
night marine air temperature. This adjusted the early bucket
observations upwards by a few tenths of a degree celsius.
Most of the ship observations are taken in narrow shipping
lanes, so the second advance has been increasing global
coverage in a variety of ways. Direct improvement of coverage
has been achieved by the internationally coordinated placement
of drifting and moored buoys. The buoys began to be numerous
enough to make signifi cant contributions to SST analyses in
the mid-1980s (McPhaden et al., 1998) and have subsequently
increased to more than 1,000 buoys transmitting data at any one
time. Since 1982, satellite data, anchored to in situ observations,
have contributed to near-global coverage (Reynolds and Smith,
1994). In addition, several different approaches have been used
to interpolate and combine land and ocean observations into the
current global temperature time series (Section 3.2). To place
the current instrumental observations into a longer historical
context requires the use of proxy data (Section 6.2).
Figure 1.3 depicts several historical ‘global’ temperature
time series, together with the longest of the current global
temperature time series, that of Brohan et al. (2006; Section
3.2). While the data and the analysis techniques have changed
over time, all the time series show a high degree of consistency
since 1900. The differences caused by using alternate data
sources and interpolation techniques increase when the data
are sparser. This phenomenon is especially illustrated by the
pre-1880 values of Willett’s (1950) time series. Willett noted
that his data coverage remained fairly constant after 1885 but
dropped off dramatically before that time to only 11 stations
before 1850. The high degree of agreement between the time
series resulting from these many different analyses increases
the confi dence that the changes they are indicating are real.
Despite the fact that many recent observations are automatic,
the vast majority of data that go into global surface temperature
calculations – over 400 million individual readings of
thermometers at land stations and over 140 million individual
in situ SST observations – have depended on the dedication of
tens of thousands of individuals for well over a century. Climate
science owes a great debt to the work of these individual weather
observers as well as to international organisations such as the
IMO, WMO and the Global Climate Observing System, which
encourage the taking and sharing of high-quality meteorological
observations. While modern researchers and their institutions
put a great deal of time and effort into acquiring and adjusting
the data to account for all known problems and biases,
century-scale global temperature time series would not have
been possible without the conscientious work of individuals
and organisations worldwide dedicated to quantifying and
documenting their local environment (Section 3.2).
1.3.3 Detection and Attribution
Using knowledge of past climates to qualify the nature of
ongoing changes has become a concern of growing importance
during the last decades, as refl ected in the successive IPCC
reports. While linked together at a technical level, detection
and attribution have separate objectives. Detection of climate
Chapter 1 change is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed
in some defi ned statistical sense, without providing a reason
for that change. Attribution of causes of climate change is
the process of establishing the most likely causes for the
detected change with some defi ned level of confi dence. Using
traditional approaches, unequivocal attribution would require
controlled experimentation with our climate system. However,
with no spare Earth with which to experiment, attribution
of anthropogenic climate change must be pursued by: (a)
detecting that the climate has changed (as defi ned above);
(b) demonstrating that the detected change is consistent with
computer model simulations of the climate change ‘signal’ that
is calculated to occur in response to anthropogenic forcing; and
(c) demonstrating that the detected change is not consistent with
alternative, physically plausible explanations of recent climate
change that exclude important anthropogenic forcings.
Both detection and attribution rely on observational data
and model output. In spite of the efforts described in Section
1.3.2, estimates of century-scale natural climate fl uctuations
remain diffi cult to obtain directly from observations due to the
relatively short length of most observational records and a lack
of understanding of the full range and effects of the various
and ongoing external infl uences. Model simulations with no
changes in external forcing (e.g., no increases in atmospheric
CO2 concentration) provide valuable information on the natural
internal variability of the climate system on time scales of years
to centuries. Attribution, on the other hand, requires output from
model runs that incorporate historical estimates of changes in
key anthropogenic and natural forcings, such as well-mixed
greenhouse gases, volcanic aerosols and solar irradiance. These
simulations can be performed with changes in a single forcing
only (which helps to isolate the climate effect of that forcing),
or with simultaneous changes in a whole suite of forcings.
In the early years of detection and attribution research, the
focus was on a single time series – the estimated global-mean
changes in the Earth’s surface temperature. While it was not
possible to detect anthropogenic warming in 1980, Madden
and Ramanathan (1980) and Hansen et al. (1981) predicted it
would be evident at least within the next two decades. A decade
later, Wigley and Raper (1990) used a simple energy-balance
climate model to show that the observed change in global-mean
surface temperature from 1867 to 1982 could not be explained
by natural internal variability. This fi nding was later confi rmed
using variability estimates from more complex coupled ocean-
atmosphere general circulation models (e.g., Stouffer et al.,
1994).
As the science of climate change progressed, detection
and attribution research ventured into more sophisticated
statistical analyses that examined complex patterns of climate
change. Climate change patterns or ‘fi ngerprints’ were no
longer limited to a single variable (temperature) or to the
Earth’s surface. More recent detection and attribution work
has made use of precipitation and global pressure patterns,
and analysis of vertical profi les of temperature change in the
ocean and atmosphere. Studies with multiple variables make it
easier to address attribution issues. While two different climate
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
forcings may yield similar changes in global mean temperature,
it is highly unlikely that they will produce exactly the same
‘fi ngerprint’ (i.e., climate changes that are identical as a function
of latitude, longitude, height, season and history over the
20th century).
Such model-predicted fi ngerprints of anthropogenic climate
change are clearly statistically identifi able in observed data.
The common conclusion of a wide range of fi ngerprint studies
conducted over the past 15 years is that observed climate changes
cannot be explained by natural factors alone (Santer et al.,
1995, 1996a,b,c; Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997, 2000; Hasselmann,
1997; Barnett et al., 1999; Tett et al., 1999; Stott et al., 2000). A
substantial anthropogenic infl uence is required in order to best
explain the observed changes. The evidence from this body of
work strengthens the scientifi c case for a discernible human
infl uence on global climate.
1.4 Examples of Progress in
Understanding Climate Processes
1.4.1 The Earth’s Greenhouse Effect
The realisation that Earth’s climate might be sensitive to the
atmospheric concentrations of gases that create a greenhouse
effect is more than a century old. Fleming (1998) and Weart
(2003) provided an overview of the emerging science. In terms
of the energy balance of the climate system, Edme Mariotte
noted in 1681 that although the Sun’s light and heat easily pass
through glass and other transparent materials, heat from other
sources (chaleur de feu) does not. The ability to generate an
artifi cial warming of the Earth’s surface was demonstrated in
simple greenhouse experiments such as Horace Benedict de
Saussure’s experiments in the 1760s using a ‘heliothermometer’
(panes of glass covering a thermometer in a darkened box) to
provide an early analogy to the greenhouse effect. It was a
conceptual leap to recognise that the air itself could also trap
thermal radiation. In 1824, Joseph Fourier, citing Saussure,
argued ‘the temperature [of the Earth] can be augmented by
the interposition of the atmosphere, because heat in the state
of light fi nds less resistance in penetrating the air, than in
repassing into the air when converted into non-luminous heat’.
In 1836, Pouillit followed up on Fourier’s ideas and argued
‘the atmospheric stratum…exercises a greater absorption
upon the terrestrial than on the solar rays’. There was still no
understanding of exactly what substance in the atmosphere was
responsible for this absorption.
In 1859, John Tyndall (1861) identifi ed through laboratory
experiments the absorption of thermal radiation by complex
molecules (as opposed to the primary bimolecular atmospheric
constituents O2 and molecular nitrogen). He noted that changes
in the amount of any of the radiatively active constituents of the
atmosphere such as water (H2O) or CO2 could have produced
‘all the mutations of climate which the researches of geologists
103

Frequently Asked Question 1.2
What is the Relationship between Climate Change
and Weather?
Climate is generally defi ned as average weather, and as such,
climate change and weather are intertwined. Observations can
show that there have been changes in weather, and it is the statis-
tics of changes in weather over time that identify climate change.
While weather and climate are closely related, there are important
differences. A common confusion between weather and climate
arises when scientists are asked how they can predict climate 50
years from now when they cannot predict the weather a few weeks
from now. The chaotic nature of weather makes it unpredictable
beyond a few days. Projecting changes in climate (i.e., long-term
average weather) due to changes in atmospheric composition or
other factors is a very different and much more manageable issue.
As an analogy, while it is impossible to predict the age at which
any particular man will die, we can say with high confi dence that
the average age of death for men in industrialised countries is
about 75. Another common confusion of these issues is thinking
that a cold winter or a cooling spot on the globe is evidence against
global warming. There are always extremes of hot and cold, al-
though their frequency and intensity change as climate changes.
But when weather is averaged over space and time, the fact that
the globe is warming emerges clearly from the data.
Meteorologists put a great deal of effort into observing, un-
derstanding and predicting the day-to-day evolution of weath-
er systems. Using physics-based concepts that govern how the
atmosphere moves, warms, cools, rains, snows, and evaporates
water, meteorologists are typically able to predict the weather
successfully several days into the future. A major limiting factor
to the predictability of weather beyond several days is a funda-
mental dynamical property of the atmosphere. In the 1960s, me-
teorologist Edward Lorenz discovered that very slight differences
in initial conditions can produce very different forecast results.

Chapter 1 This is the so-called butterfl y effect: a butterfl y fl apping its wings
(or some other small phenomenon) in one place can, in principle,
alter the subsequent weather pattern in a distant place. At the
core of this effect is chaos theory, which deals with how small
changes in certain variables can cause apparent randomness in
complex systems.
Nevertheless, chaos theory does not imply a total lack of or-
der. For example, slightly different conditions early in its history
might alter the day a storm system would arrive or the exact path
it would take, but the average temperature and precipitation (that
is, climate) would still be about the same for that region and that
period of time. Because a signifi cant problem facing weather fore-
casting is knowing all the conditions at the start of the forecast
period, it can be useful to think of climate as dealing with the
background conditions for weather. More precisely, climate can
be viewed as concerning the status of the entire Earth system, in-
cluding the atmosphere, land, oceans, snow, ice and living things
(see Figure 1) that serve as the global background conditions that
determine weather patterns. An example of this would be an El
Niño affecting the weather in coastal Peru. The El Niño sets limits
on the probable evolution of weather patterns that random effects
can produce. A La Niña would set different limits.
Another example is found in the familiar contrast between
summer and winter. The march of the seasons is due to changes in
the geographical patterns of energy absorbed and radiated away
by the Earth system. Likewise, projections of future climate are
reveal’. In 1895, Svante Arrhenius (1896) followed with a
climate prediction based on greenhouse gases, suggesting that
a 40% increase or decrease in the atmospheric abundance of the
trace gas CO2 might trigger the glacial advances and retreats.
One hundred years later, it would be found that CO2 did indeed
vary by this amount between glacial and interglacial periods.
However, it now appears that the initial climatic change preceded
the change in CO2 but was enhanced by it (Section 6.4).
G. S. Callendar (1938) solved a set of equations linking
greenhouse gases and climate change. He found that a doubling
of atmospheric CO2 concentration resulted in an increase
in the mean global temperature of 2°C, with considerably
more warming at the poles, and linked increasing fossil fuel
combustion with a rise in CO2 and its greenhouse effects: ‘As
man is now changing the composition of the atmosphere at a
rate which must be very exceptional on the geological time
scale, it is natural to seek for the probable effects of such a
change. From the best laboratory observations it appears that
the principal result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide…
would be a gradual increase in the mean temperature of the
colder regions of the Earth.’ In 1947, Ahlmann reported a 1.3°C
warming in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic since the 19th
century and mistakenly believed this climate variation could be
explained entirely by greenhouse gas warming. Similar model
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
shaped by fundamental changes in heat energy in the Earth sys-
tem, in particular the increasing intensity of the greenhouse effect
that traps heat near Earth’s surface, determined by the amount of
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Projecting changes in climate due to changes in greenhouse gas-
es 50 years from now is a very different and much more easily
solved problem than forecasting weather patterns just weeks from
now. To put it another way, long-term variations brought about
by changes in the composition of the atmosphere are much more
predictable than individual weather events. As an example, while
we cannot predict the outcome of a single coin toss or roll of the
dice, we can predict the statistical behaviour of a large number
of such trials.
While many factors continue to infl uence climate, scientists
have determined that human activities have become a dominant
force, and are responsible for most of the warming observed over
the past 50 years. Human-caused climate change has resulted pri-
marily from changes in the amounts of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere, but also from changes in small particles (aerosols), as
well as from changes in land use, for example. As climate changes,
the probabilities of certain types of weather events are affected.
For example, as Earth’s average temperature has increased, some
weather phenomena have become more frequent and intense (e.g.,
heat waves and heavy downpours), while others have become less
frequent and intense (e.g., extreme cold events).
predictions were echoed by Plass in 1956 (see Fleming, 1998):
‘If at the end of this century, measurements show that the carbon
dioxide content of the atmosphere has risen appreciably and at
the same time the temperature has continued to rise throughout
the world, it will be fi rmly established that carbon dioxide is an
important factor in causing climatic change’ (see Chapter 9).
In trying to understand the carbon cycle, and specifi cally
how fossil fuel emissions would change atmospheric CO2, the
interdisciplinary fi eld of carbon cycle science began. One of the
fi rst problems addressed was the atmosphere-ocean exchange
of CO2. Revelle and Suess (1957) explained why part of the
emitted CO2 was observed to accumulate in the atmosphere
rather than being completely absorbed by the oceans. While
CO2 can be mixed rapidly into the upper layers of the ocean,
the time to mix with the deep ocean is many centuries. By
the time of the TAR, the interaction of climate change with
the oceanic circulation and biogeochemistry was projected to
reduce the fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions taken up
by the oceans in the future, leaving a greater fraction in the
atmosphere (Sections 7.1, 7.3 and 10.4).
In the 1950s, the greenhouse gases of concern remained
CO2 and H2O, the same two identifi ed by Tyndall a century
earlier. It was not until the 1970s that other greenhouse
gases – CH4, N2O and CFCs – were widely recognised as
105
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science important anthropogenic greenhouse gases (Ramanathan, 1975;
Wang et al., 1976; Section 2.3). By the 1970s, the importance
of aerosol-cloud effects in refl ecting sunlight was known
(Twomey, 1977), and atmospheric aerosols (suspended small
particles) were being proposed as climate-forcing constituents.
Charlson and others (summarised in Charlson et al., 1990) built
a consensus that sulphate aerosols were, by themselves, cooling
the Earth’s surface by directly refl ecting sunlight. Moreover, the
increases in sulphate aerosols were anthropogenic and linked
with the main source of CO2, burning of fossil fuels (Section
2.4). Thus, the current picture of the atmospheric constituents
driving climate change contains a much more diverse mix of
greenhouse agents.
1.4.2 Past Climate Observations, Astronomical
Theory and Abrupt Climate Changes
Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, a wide range of
geomorphology and palaeontology studies has provided new
insight into the Earth’s past climates, covering periods of
hundreds of millions of years. The Palaeozoic Era, beginning
600 Ma, displayed evidence of both warmer and colder climatic
conditions than the present; the Tertiary Period (65 to 2.6 Ma)
was generally warmer; and the Quaternary Period (2.6 Ma to
the present – the ice ages) showed oscillations between glacial
and interglacial conditions. Louis Agassiz (1837) developed the
hypothesis that Europe had experienced past glacial ages, and
there has since been a growing awareness that long-term climate
observations can advance the understanding of the physical
mechanisms affecting climate change. The scientifi c study of
one such mechanism – modifi cations in the geographical and
temporal patterns of solar energy reaching the Earth’s surface
due to changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters – has a long
history. The pioneering contributions of Milankovitch (1941) to
this astronomical theory of climate change are widely known,
and the historical review of Imbrie and Imbrie (1979) calls
attention to much earlier contributions, such as those of James
Croll, originating in 1864.
The pace of palaeoclimatic research has accelerated
over recent decades. Quantitative and well-dated records of
climate fl uctuations over the last 100 kyr have brought a more
comprehensive view of how climate changes occur, as well
as the means to test elements of the astronomical theory. By
the 1950s, studies of deep-sea cores suggested that the ocean
temperatures may have been different during glacial times
(Emiliani, 1955). Ewing and Donn (1956) proposed that
changes in ocean circulation actually could initiate an ice age.
In the 1960s, the works of Emiliani (1969) and Shackleton
(1967) showed the potential of isotopic measurements in deep-
sea sediments to help explain Quaternary changes. In the 1970s,
it became possible to analyse a deep-sea core time series of
more than 700 kyr, thereby using the last reversal of the Earth’s
magnetic fi eld to establish a dated chronology. This deep-sea
observational record clearly showed the same periodicities
found in the astronomical forcing, immediately providing
strong support to Milankovitch’s theory (Hays et al., 1976).
106
Chapter 1
Ice cores provide key information about past climates,
including surface temperatures and atmospheric chemical
composition. The bubbles sealed in the ice are the only available
samples of these past atmospheres. The fi rst deep ice cores from
Vostok in Antarctica (Barnola et al., 1987; Jouzel et al., 1987,
1993) provided additional evidence of the role of astronomical
forcing. They also revealed a highly correlated evolution of
temperature changes and atmospheric composition, which
was subsequently confi rmed over the past 400 kyr (Petit et al.,
1999) and now extends to almost 1 Myr. This discovery drove
research to understand the causal links between greenhouse
gases and climate change. The same data that confi rmed the
astronomical theory also revealed its limits: a linear response
of the climate system to astronomical forcing could not explain
entirely the observed fl uctuations of rapid ice-age terminations
preceded by longer cycles of glaciations.
The importance of other sources of climate variability was
heightened by the discovery of abrupt climate changes. In this
context, ‘abrupt’ designates regional events of large amplitude,
typically a few degrees celsius, which occurred within several
decades – much shorter than the thousand-year time scales
that characterise changes in astronomical forcing. Abrupt
temperature changes were fi rst revealed by the analysis of deep
ice cores from Greenland (Dansgaard et al., 1984). Oeschger
et al. (1984) recognised that the abrupt changes during the
termination of the last ice age correlated with cooling in
Gerzensee (Switzerland) and suggested that regime shifts in
the Atlantic Ocean circulation were causing these widespread
changes. The synthesis of palaeoclimatic observations by
Broecker and Denton (1989) invigorated the community over
the next decade. By the end of the 1990s, it became clear that
the abrupt climate changes during the last ice age, particularly in
the North Atlantic regions as found in the Greenland ice cores,
were numerous (Dansgaard et al., 1993), indeed abrupt (Alley
et al., 1993) and of large amplitude (Severinghaus and Brook,
1999). They are now referred to as Dansgaard-Oeschger events.
A similar variability is seen in the North Atlantic Ocean, with
north-south oscillations of the polar front (Bond et al., 1992) and
associated changes in ocean temperature and salinity (Cortijo et
al., 1999). With no obvious external forcing, these changes are
thought to be manifestations of the internal variability of the
climate system.
The importance of internal variability and processes was
reinforced in the early 1990s with analysis of records with
high temporal resolution. New ice cores (Greenland Ice Core
Project, Johnsen et al., 1992; Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2,
Grootes et al., 1993), new ocean cores from regions with high
sedimentation rates, as well as lacustrine sediments and cave
stalagmites produced additional evidence for unforced climate
changes, and revealed a large number of abrupt changes in many
regions throughout the last glacial cycle. Long sediment cores
from the deep ocean were used to reconstruct the thermohaline
circulation connecting deep and surface waters (Bond et al.,
1992; Broecker, 1997) and to demonstrate the participation
of the ocean in these abrupt climate changes during glacial
periods.
Chapter 1 By the end of the 1990s, palaeoclimate proxies for a range
of climate observations had expanded greatly. The analysis
of deep corals provided indicators for nutrient content and
mass exchange from the surface to deep water (Adkins et al.,
1998), showing abrupt variations characterised by synchronous
changes in surface and deep-water properties (Shackleton et
al., 2000). Precise measurements of the CH4 abundances (a
global quantity) in polar ice cores showed that they changed in
concert with the Dansgaard-Oeschger events and thus allowed
for synchronisation of the dating across ice cores (Blunier
et al., 1998). The characteristics of the antarctic temperature
variations and their relation to the Dansgaard-Oeschger events in
Greenland were consistent with the simple concept of a bipolar
seesaw caused by changes in the thermohaline circulation of
the Atlantic Ocean (Stocker, 1998). This work underlined the
role of the ocean in transmitting the signals of abrupt climate
change.
Abrupt changes are often regional, for example, severe
droughts lasting for many years have changed civilizations, and
have occurred during the last 10 kyr of stable warm climate
(deMenocal, 2001). This result has altered the notion of a stable
climate during warm epochs, as previously suggested by the
polar ice cores. The emerging picture of an unstable ocean-
atmosphere system has opened the debate of whether human
interference through greenhouse gases and aerosols could
trigger such events (Broecker, 1997).
Palaeoclimate reconstructions cited in the FAR were based
on various data, including pollen records, insect and animal
remains, oxygen isotopes and other geological data from lake
varves, loess, ocean sediments, ice cores and glacier termini.
These records provided estimates of climate variability on
time scales up to millions of years. A climate proxy is a local
quantitative record (e.g., thickness and chemical properties of
tree rings, pollen of different species) that is interpreted as a
climate variable (e.g., temperature or rainfall) using a transfer
function that is based on physical principles and recently
observed correlations between the two records. The combination
of instrumental and proxy data began in the 1960s with the
investigation of the infl uence of climate on the proxy data,
including tree rings (Fritts, 1962), corals (Weber and Woodhead,
1972; Dunbar and Wellington, 1981) and ice cores (Dansgaard
et al., 1984; Jouzel et al., 1987). Phenological and historical
data (e.g., blossoming dates, harvest dates, grain prices,
ships’ logs, newspapers, weather diaries, ancient manuscripts)
are also a valuable source of climatic reconstruction for the
period before instrumental records became available. Such
documentary data also need calibration against instrumental
data to extend and reconstruct the instrumental record (Lamb,
1969; Zhu, 1973; van den Dool, 1978; Brazdil, 1992; Pfi ster,
1992). With the development of multi-proxy reconstructions,
the climate data were extended not only from local to global,
but also from instrumental data to patterns of climate variability
(Wanner et al., 1995; Mann et al., 1998; Luterbacher et al.,
1999). Most of these reconstructions were at single sites and
only loose efforts had been made to consolidate records. Mann
et al. (1998) made a notable advance in the use of proxy data by
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
ensuring that the dating of different records lined up. Thus, the
true spatial patterns of temperature variability and change could
be derived, and estimates of NH average surface temperatures
were obtained.
The Working Group I (WGI) WGI FAR noted that past
climates could provide analogues. Fifteen years of research
since that assessment has identifi ed a range of variations and
instabilities in the climate system that occurred during the last
2 Myr of glacial-interglacial cycles and in the super-warm period
of 50 Ma. These past climates do not appear to be analogues of
the immediate future, yet they do reveal a wide range of climate
processes that need to be understood when projecting 21st-
century climate change (see Chapter 6).
1.4.3 Solar Variability and the Total Solar
Irradiance
Measurement of the absolute value of total solar irradiance
(TSI) is diffi cult from the Earth’s surface because of the need
to correct for the infl uence of the atmosphere. Langley (1884)
attempted to minimise the atmospheric effects by taking
measurements from high on Mt. Whitney in California, and
to estimate the correction for atmospheric effects by taking
measurements at several times of day, for example, with the
solar radiation having passed through different atmospheric
pathlengths. Between 1902 and 1957, Charles Abbot and a
number of other scientists around the globe made thousands of
measurements of TSI from mountain sites. Values ranged from
1,322 to 1,465 W m–2, which encompasses the current estimate
of 1,365 W m–2. Foukal et al. (1977) deduced from Abbot’s
daily observations that higher values of TSI were associated
with more solar faculae (e.g., Abbot, 1910).
In 1978, the Nimbus-7 satellite was launched with a cavity
radiometer and provided evidence of variations in TSI (Hickey
et al., 1980). Additional observations were made with an active
cavity radiometer on the Solar Maximum Mission, launched
in 1980 (Willson et al., 1980). Both of these missions showed
that the passage of sunspots and faculae across the Sun’s disk
infl uenced TSI. At the maximum of the 11-year solar activity
cycle, the TSI is larger by about 0.1% than at the minimum.
The observation that TSI is highest when sunspots are at their
maximum is the opposite of Langley’s (1876) hypothesis.
As early as 1910, Abbot believed that he had detected a
downward trend in TSI that coincided with a general cooling
of climate. The solar cycle variation in irradiance corresponds
to an 11-year cycle in radiative forcing which varies by about
0.2 W m–2. There is increasingly reliable evidence of its
infl uence on atmospheric temperatures and circulations,
particularly in the higher atmosphere (Reid, 1991; Brasseur,
1993; Balachandran and Rind, 1995; Haigh, 1996; Labitzke and
van Loon, 1997; van Loon and Labitzke, 2000). Calculations
with three-dimensional models (Wetherald and Manabe, 1975;
Cubasch et al., 1997; Lean and Rind, 1998; Tett et al., 1999;
Cubasch and Voss, 2000) suggest that the changes in solar
radiation could cause surface temperature changes of the order
of a few tenths of a degree celsius.
107
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science For the time before satellite measurements became available,
the solar radiation variations can be inferred from cosmogenic
isotopes (10Be, 14C) and from the sunspot number. Naked-eye
observations of sunspots date back to ancient times, but it was
only after the invention of the telescope in 1607 that it became
possible to routinely monitor the number, size and position of
these ‘stains’ on the surface of the Sun. Throughout the 17th
and 18th centuries, numerous observers noted the variable
concentrations and ephemeral nature of sunspots, but very few
sightings were reported between 1672 and 1699 (for an overview
see Hoyt et al., 1994). This period of low solar activity, now
known as the Maunder Minimum, occurred during the climate
period now commonly referred to as the Little Ice Age (Eddy,
1976). There is no exact agreement as to which dates mark the
beginning and end of the Little Ice Age, but from about 1350 to
about 1850 is one reasonable estimate.
During the latter part of the 18th century, Wilhelm Herschel
(1801) noted the presence not only of sunspots but of bright
patches, now referred to as faculae, and of granulations on
the solar surface. He believed that when these indicators of
activity were more numerous, solar emissions of light and heat
were greater and could affect the weather on Earth. Heinrich
Schwabe (1844) published his discovery of a ‘10-year cycle’
in sunspot numbers. Samuel Langley (1876) compared the
brightness of sunspots with that of the surrounding photosphere.
He concluded that they would block the emission of radiation
and estimated that at sunspot cycle maximum the Sun would be
about 0.1% less bright than at the minimum of the cycle, and
that the Earth would be 0.1°C to 0.3°C cooler.
These satellite data have been used in combination with the
historically recorded sunspot number, records of cosmogenic
isotopes, and the characteristics of other Sun-like stars to
estimate the solar radiation over the last 1,000 years (Eddy,
1976; Hoyt and Schatten, 1993, 1997; Lean et al., 1995; Lean,
1997). These data sets indicated quasi-periodic changes in solar
radiation of 0.24 to 0.30% on the centennial time scale. These
values have recently been re-assessed (see, e.g., Chapter 2).
The TAR states that the changes in solar irradiance are not
the major cause of the temperature changes in the second half
of the 20th century unless those changes can induce unknown
large feedbacks in the climate system. The effects of galactic
cosmic rays on the atmosphere (via cloud nucleation) and those
due to shifts in the solar spectrum towards the ultraviolet (UV)
range, at times of high solar activity, are largely unknown. The
latter may produce changes in tropospheric circulation via
changes in static stability resulting from the interaction of the
increased UV radiation with stratospheric ozone. More research
to investigate the effects of solar behaviour on climate is needed
before the magnitude of solar effects on climate can be stated
with certainty.
1.4.4 Biogeochemistry and Radiative Forcing
The modern scientifi c understanding of the complex and
interconnected roles of greenhouse gases and aerosols in
climate change has undergone rapid evolution over the last
108
Chapter 1
two decades. While the concepts were recognised and outlined
in the 1970s (see Sections 1.3.1 and 1.4.1), the publication of
generally accepted quantitative results coincides with, and was
driven in part by, the questions asked by the IPCC beginning in
1988. Thus, it is instructive to view the evolution of this topic as
it has been treated in the successive IPCC reports.
The WGI FAR codifi ed the key physical and biogeochemical
processes in the Earth system that relate a changing climate to
atmospheric composition, chemistry, the carbon cycle and natural
ecosystems. The science of the time, as summarised in the FAR,
made a clear case for anthropogenic interference with the climate
system. In terms of greenhouse agents, the main conclusions
from the WGI FAR Policymakers Summary are still valid today:
(1) ‘emissions resulting from human activities are substantially
increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse
gases: CO2, CH4, CFCs, N2O’; (2) ‘some gases are potentially
more effective (at greenhouse warming)’; (3) feedbacks between
the carbon cycle, ecosystems and atmospheric greenhouse
gases in a warmer world will affect CO2 abundances; and (4)
GWPs provide a metric for comparing the climatic impact of
different greenhouse gases, one that integrates both the radiative
infl uence and biogeochemical cycles. The climatic importance
of tropospheric ozone, sulphate aerosols and atmospheric
chemical feedbacks were proposed by scientists at the time and
noted in the assessment. For example, early global chemical
modelling results argued that global tropospheric ozone, a
greenhouse gas, was controlled by emissions of the highly
reactive gases nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO)
and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC, also known as volatile
organic compounds, VOC). In terms of sulphate aerosols, both
the direct radiative effects and the indirect effects on clouds were
acknowledged, but the importance of carbonaceous aerosols
from fossil fuel and biomass combustion was not recognised
(Chapters 2, 7 and 10).
The concept of radiative forcing (RF) as the radiative
imbalance (W m–2) in the climate system at the top of the
atmosphere caused by the addition of a greenhouse gas (or
other change) was established at the time and summarised in
Chapter 2 of the WGI FAR. Agents of RF included the direct
greenhouse gases, solar radiation, aerosols and the Earth’s
surface albedo. What was new and only briefl y mentioned
was that ‘many gases produce indirect effects on the global
radiative forcing’. The innovative global modelling work of
Derwent (1990) showed that emissions of the reactive but non-
greenhouse gases – NOx, CO and NMHCs – altered atmospheric
chemistry and thus changed the abundance of other greenhouse
gases. Indirect GWPs for NOx, CO and VOCs were proposed.
The projected chemical feedbacks were limited to short-lived
increases in tropospheric ozone. By 1990, it was clear that the
RF from tropospheric ozone had increased over the 20th century
and stratospheric ozone had decreased since 1980 (e.g., Lacis
et al., 1990), but the associated RFs were not evaluated in the
assessments. Neither was the effect of anthropogenic sulphate
aerosols, except to note in the FAR that ‘it is conceivable that
this radiative forcing has been of a comparable magnitude,
but of opposite sign, to the greenhouse forcing earlier in the
Chapter 1 century’. Refl ecting in general the community’s concerns about
this relatively new measure of climate forcing, RF bar charts
appear only in the underlying FAR chapters, but not in the FAR
Summary. Only the long-lived greenhouse gases are shown,
although sulphate aerosols direct effect in the future is noted
with a question mark (i.e., dependent on future emissions)
(Chapters 2, 7 and 10).
The cases for more complex chemical and aerosol effects
were becoming clear, but the scientifi c community was unable at
the time to reach general agreement on the existence, scale and
magnitude of these indirect effects. Nevertheless, these early
discoveries drove the research agendas in the early 1990s. The
widespread development and application of global chemistry-
transport models had just begun with international workshops
(Pyle et al., 1996; Jacob et al., 1997; Rasch, 2000). In the
Supplementary Report (IPCC, 1992) to the FAR, the indirect
chemical effects of CO, NOx and VOC were reaffi rmed, and
the feedback effect of CH4 on the tropospheric hydroxyl radical
(OH) was noted, but the indirect RF values from the FAR were
retracted and denoted in a table with ‘+’, ‘0’ or ‘–’. Aerosol-
climate interactions still focused on sulphates, and the assessment
of their direct RF for the NH (i.e., a cooling) was now somewhat
quantitative as compared to the FAR. Stratospheric ozone
depletion was noted as causing a signifi cant and negative RF, but
not quantifi ed. Ecosystems research at this time was identifying
the responses to climate change and CO2 increases, as well as
altered CH4 and N2O fl uxes from natural systems; however, in
terms of a community assessment it remained qualitative.
By 1994, with work on SAR progressing, the Special
Report on Radiative Forcing (IPCC, 1995) reported signifi cant
breakthroughs in a set of chapters limited to assessment of the
carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry, aerosols and RF. The
carbon budget for the 1980s was analysed not only from bottom-
up emissions estimates, but also from a top-down approach
including carbon isotopes. A fi rst carbon cycle assessment
was performed through an international model and analysis
workshop examining terrestrial and oceanic uptake to better
quantify the relationship between CO2 emissions and the
resulting increase in atmospheric abundance. Similarly,
expanded analyses of the global budgets of trace gases
and aerosols from both natural and anthropogenic sources
highlighted the rapid expansion of biogeochemical research.
The fi rst RF bar chart appears, comparing all the major
components of RF change from the pre-industrial period to the
present. Anthropogenic soot aerosol, with a positive RF, was
not in the 1995 Special Report but was added to the SAR. In
terms of atmospheric chemistry, the fi rst open-invitation
modelling study for the IPCC recruited 21 atmospheric chemistry
models to participate in a controlled study of photochemistry
and chemical feedbacks. These studies (e.g., Olson et al., 1997)
demonstrated a robust consensus about some indirect effects,
such as the CH4 impact on atmospheric chemistry, but great
uncertainty about others, such as the prediction of tropospheric
ozone changes. The model studies plus the theory of chemical
feedbacks in the CH4-CO-OH system (Prather, 1994) fi rmly
established that the atmospheric lifetime of a perturbation
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
(and hence climate impact and GWP) of CH4 emissions was
about 50% greater than reported in the FAR. There was still
no consensus on quantifying the past or future changes in
tropospheric ozone or OH (the primary sink for CH4) (Chapters
2, 7 and 10).
In the early 1990s, research on aerosols as climate forcing
agents expanded. Based on new research, the range of climate-
relevant aerosols was extended for the fi rst time beyond
sulphates to include nitrates, organics, soot, mineral dust and sea
salt. Quantitative estimates of sulphate aerosol indirect effects on
cloud properties and hence RF were suffi ciently well established
to be included in assessments, and carbonaceous aerosols from
biomass burning were recognised as being comparable in
importance to sulphate (Penner et al., 1992). Ranges are given
in the special report (IPCC, 1995) for direct sulphate RF (–0.25
to –0.9 W m–2) and biomass-burning aerosols (–0.05 to –0.6
W m–2). The aerosol indirect RF was estimated to be about
equal to the direct RF, but with larger uncertainty. The injection
of stratospheric aerosols from the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo was
noted as the fi rst modern test of a known radiative forcing, and
indeed one climate model accurately predicted the temperature
response (Hansen et al., 1992). In the one-year interval between
the special report and the SAR, the scientifi c understanding of
aerosols grew. The direct anthropogenic aerosol forcing (from
sulphate, fossil-fuel soot and biomass-burning aerosols) was
reduced to –0.5 W m–2. The RF bar chart was now broken into
aerosol components (sulphate, fossil-fuel soot and biomass
burning aerosols) with a separate range for indirect effects
(Chapters 2 and 7; Sections 8.2 and 9.2).
Throughout the 1990s, there were concerted research programs
in the USA and EU to evaluate the global environmental impacts
of aviation. Several national assessments culminated in the IPCC
Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere (IPCC,
1999), which assessed the impacts on climate and global air
quality. An open invitation for atmospheric model participation
resulted in community participation and a consensus on many
of the environmental impacts of aviation (e.g., the increase in
tropospheric ozone and decrease in CH4 due to NOx emissions
were quantifi ed). The direct RF of sulphate and of soot aerosols
was likewise quantifi ed along with that of contrails, but the
impact on cirrus clouds that are sometimes generated downwind
of contrails was not. The assessment re-affi rmed that RF was
a fi rst-order metric for the global mean surface temperature
response, but noted that it was inadequate for regional climate
change, especially in view of the largely regional forcing from
aerosols and tropospheric ozone (Sections 2.6, 2.8 and 10.2).
By the end of the 1990s, research on atmospheric composition
and climate forcing had made many important advances. The
TAR was able to provide a more quantitative evaluation in some
areas. For example, a large, open-invitation modelling workshop
was held for both aerosols (11 global models) and tropospheric
ozone-OH chemistry (14 global models). This workshop brought
together as collaborating authors most of the international
scientifi c community involved in developing and testing global
models of atmospheric composition. In terms of atmospheric
chemistry, a strong consensus was reached for the fi rst time
109
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science that science could predict the changes in tropospheric ozone in
response to scenarios for CH4 and the indirect greenhouse gases
(CO, NOx, VOC) and that a quantitative GWP for CO could be
reported. Further, combining these models with observational
analysis, an estimate of the change in tropospheric ozone since
the pre-industrial era – with uncertainties – was reported. The
aerosol workshop made similar advances in evaluating the
impact of different aerosol types. There were many different
representations of uncertainty (e.g., a range in models versus
an expert judgment) in the TAR, and the consensus RF bar
chart did not generate a total RF or uncertainties for use in the
subsequent IPCC Synthesis Report (IPCC, 2001b) (Chapters 2
and 7; Section 9.2).
1.4.5 Cryospheric Topics
The cryosphere, which includes the ice sheets of Greenland
and Antarctica, continental (including tropical) glaciers, snow,
sea ice, river and lake ice, permafrost and seasonally frozen
ground, is an important component of the climate system. The
cryosphere derives its importance to the climate system from
a variety of effects, including its high refl ectivity (albedo) for
solar radiation, its low thermal conductivity, its large thermal
inertia, its potential for affecting ocean circulation (through
exchange of freshwater and heat) and atmospheric circulation
(through topographic changes), its large potential for affecting
sea level (through growth and melt of land ice), and its potential
for affecting greenhouse gases (through changes in permafrost)
(Chapter 4).
Studies of the cryospheric albedo feedback have a long
history. The albedo is the fraction of solar energy refl ected back
to space. Over snow and ice, the albedo (about 0.7 to 0.9) is
large compared to that over the oceans (<0.1). In a warming
climate, it is anticipated that the cryosphere would shrink,
the Earth’s overall albedo would decrease and more solar
energy would be absorbed to warm the Earth still further. This
powerful feedback loop was recognised in the 19th century
by Croll (1890) and was fi rst introduced in climate models by
Budyko (1969) and Sellers (1969). But although the principle
of the albedo feedback is simple, a quantitative understanding
of the effect is still far from complete. For instance, it is not
clear whether this mechanism is the main reason for the high-
latitude amplifi cation of the warming signal.
The potential cryospheric impact on ocean circulation and
sea level are of particular importance. There may be ‘large-scale
discontinuities’ (IPCC, 2001a) resulting from both the shutdown
of the large-scale meridional circulation of the world oceans
(see Section 1.4.6) and the disintegration of large continental
ice sheets. Mercer (1968, 1978) proposed that atmospheric
warming could cause the ice shelves of western Antarctica to
disintegrate and that as a consequence the entire West Antarctic
Ice Sheet (10% of the antarctic ice volume) would lose its land
connection and come afl oat, causing a sea level rise of about
fi ve metres.
The importance of permafrost-climate feedbacks came to be
realised widely only in the 1990s, starting with the works of
110
Chapter 1
Kvenvolden (1988, 1993), MacDonald (1990) and Harriss et al.
(1993). As permafrost thaws due to a warmer climate, CO2 and
CH4 trapped in permafrost are released to the atmosphere. Since
CO2 and CH4 are greenhouse gases, atmospheric temperature is
likely to increase in turn, resulting in a feedback loop with more
permafrost thawing. The permafrost and seasonally thawed soil
layers at high latitudes contain a signifi cant amount (about
one-quarter) of the global total amount of soil carbon. Because
global warming signals are amplifi ed in high-latitude regions,
the potential for permafrost thawing and consequent greenhouse
gas releases is thus large.
In situ monitoring of the cryosphere has a long tradition. For
instance, it is important for fi sheries and agriculture. Seagoing
communities have documented sea ice extent for centuries.
Records of thaw and freeze dates for lake and river ice start
with Lake Suwa in Japan in 1444, and extensive records of
snowfall in China were made during the Qing Dynasty (1644–
1912). Records of glacial length go back to the mid-1500s.
Internationally coordinated, long-term glacier observations
started in 1894 with the establishment of the International
Glacier Commission in Zurich, Switzerland. The longest
time series of a glacial mass balance was started in 1946 at
the Storglaciären in northern Sweden, followed by Storbreen
in Norway (begun in 1949). Today a global network of mass
balance monitoring for some 60 glaciers is coordinated
through the World Glacier Monitoring Service. Systematic
measurements of permafrost (thermal state and active layer)
began in earnest around 1950 and were coordinated under the
Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost.
The main climate variables of the cryosphere (extent,
albedo, topography and mass) are in principle observable from
space, given proper calibration and validation through in situ
observing efforts. Indeed, satellite data are required in order
to have full global coverage. The polar-orbiting Nimbus 5
satellite, launched in 1972, yielded the earliest all-weather, all-
season imagery of global sea ice, using microwave instruments
(Parkinson et al., 1987), and enabled a major advance in the
scientifi c understanding of the dynamics of the cryosphere.
Launched in 1978, the Television Infrared Observation Satellite
(TIROS-N) yielded the fi rst monitoring from space of snow on
land surfaces (Dozier et al., 1981). The number of cryospheric
elements now routinely monitored from space is growing, and
current satellites are now addressing one of the more challenging
elements, variability of ice volume.
Climate modelling results have pointed to high-latitude
regions as areas of particular importance and ecological
vulnerability to global climate change. It might seem logical to
expect that the cryosphere overall would shrink in a warming
climate or expand in a cooling climate. However, potential
changes in precipitation, for instance due to an altered hydrological
cycle, may counter this effect both regionally and globally.
By the time of the TAR, several climate models incorporated
physically based treatments of ice dynamics, although the land
ice processes were only rudimentary. Improving representation
of the cryosphere in climate models is still an area of intense
research and continuing progress (Chapter 8).
Chapter 1 1.4.6 Ocean and Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere
Dynamics
Developments in the understanding of the oceanic and
atmospheric circulations, as well as their interactions, constitute
a striking example of the continuous interplay among theory,
observations and, more recently, model simulations. The
atmosphere and ocean surface circulations were observed
and analysed globally as early as the 16th and 17th centuries,
in close association with the development of worldwide trade
based on sailing. These efforts led to a number of important
conceptual and theoretical works. For example, Edmund Halley
fi rst published a description of the tropical atmospheric cells in
1686, and George Hadley proposed a theory linking the existence
of the trade winds with those cells in 1735. These early studies
helped to forge concepts that are still useful in analysing and
understanding both the atmospheric general circulation itself
and model simulations (Lorenz, 1967; Holton, 1992).
A comprehensive description of these circulations was
delayed by the lack of necessary observations in the higher
atmosphere or deeper ocean. The balloon record of Gay-Lussac,
who reached an altitude of 7,016 m in 1804, remained unbroken
for more than 50 years. The stratosphere was independently
discovered near the turn of the 20th century by Aßmann (1902)
and Teisserenc de Bort (1902), and the fi rst manned balloon
fl ight into the stratosphere was made in 1901 (Berson and
Süring, 1901). Even though it was recognised over 200 years ago
(Rumford, 1800; see also Warren, 1981) that the oceans’ cold
subsurface waters must originate at high latitudes, it was not
appreciated until the 20th century that the strength of the deep
circulation might vary over time, or that the ocean’s Meridional
Overturning Circulation (MOC; often loosely referred to as
the ‘thermohaline circulation’, see the Glossary for more
information) may be very important for Earth’s climate.
By the 1950s, studies of deep-sea cores suggested that the deep
ocean temperatures had varied in the distant past. Technology
also evolved to enable measurements that could confi rm that
the deep ocean is not only not static, but in fact quite dynamic
(Swallow and Stommel’s 1960 subsurface fl oat experiment
Aries, referred to by Crease, 1962). By the late 1970s, current
meters could monitor deep currents for substantial amounts of
time, and the fi rst ocean observing satellite (SeaSat) revealed
that signifi cant information about subsurface ocean variability
is imprinted on the sea surface. At the same time, the fi rst
estimates of the strength of the meridional transport of heat
and mass were made (Oort and Vonder Haar, 1976; Wunsch,
1978), using a combination of models and data. Since then the
technological developments have accelerated, but monitoring
the MOC directly remains a substantial challenge (see Chapter
5), and routine observations of the subsurface ocean remain
scarce compared to that of the atmosphere.
In parallel with the technological developments yielding
new insights through observations, theoretical and numerical
explorations of multiple (stable or unstable) equilibria began.
Chamberlain (1906) suggested that deep ocean currents could
reverse in direction, and might affect climate. The idea did not
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
gain momentum until fi fty years later, when Stommel (1961)
presented a mechanism, based on the opposing effects that
temperature and salinity have on density, by which ocean
circulation can fl uctuate between states. Numerical climate
models incorporating models of the ocean circulation were
developed during this period, including the pioneering work of
Bryan (1969) and Manabe and Bryan (1969). The idea that the
ocean circulation could change radically, and might perhaps even
feel the attraction of different equilibrium states, gained further
support through the simulations of coupled climate models
(Bryan and Spelman, 1985; Bryan, 1986; Manabe and Stouffer,
1988). Model simulations using a hierarchy of models showed
that the ocean circulation system appeared to be particularly
vulnerable to changes in the freshwater balance, either by direct
addition of freshwater or by changes in the hydrological cycle.
A strong case emerged for the hypothesis that rapid changes
in the Atlantic meridional circulation were responsible for the
abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger climate change events.
Although scientists now better appreciate the strength
and variability of the global-scale ocean circulation, its roles
in climate are still hotly debated. Is it a passive recipient of
atmospheric forcing and so merely a diagnostic consequence
of climate change, or is it an active contributor? Observational
evidence for the latter proposition was presented by Sutton and
Allen (1997), who noticed SST anomalies propagating along
the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Current system for years, and
therefore implicated internal oceanic time scales. Is a radical
change in the MOC likely in the near future? Brewer et al. (1983)
and Lazier (1995) showed that the water masses of the North
Atlantic were indeed changing (some becoming signifi cantly
fresher) in the modern observational record, a phenomenon
that at least raises the possibility that ocean conditions may be
approaching the point where the circulation might shift into
Stommel’s other stable regime. Recent developments in the
ocean’s various roles in climate can be found in Chapters 5, 6,
9 and 10.
Studying the interactions between atmosphere and
ocean circulations was also facilitated through continuous
interactions between observations, theories and simulations,
as is dramatically illustrated by the century-long history of the
advances in understanding the El Niño-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) phenomenon. This coupled air-sea phenomenon
originates in the Pacifi c but affects climate globally, and has
raised concern since at least the 19th century. Sir Gilbert Walker
(1928) describes how H. H. Hildebrandsson (1897) noted large-
scale relationships between interannual trends in pressure data
from a worldwide network of 68 weather stations, and how
Lockyer and Lockyer (1902) confi rmed Hildebrandsson’s
discovery of an apparent ‘seesaw’ in pressure between South
America and the Indonesian region. Walker named this seesaw
pattern the ‘Southern Oscillation’ and related it to occurrences
of drought and heavy rains in India, Australia, Indonesia and
Africa. He also proposed that there must be a certain level of
predictive skill in that system.
El Niño is the name given to the rather unusual oceanic
conditions involving anomalously warm waters occurring in
111
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science the eastern tropical Pacifi c off the coast of Peru every few years.
The 1957–1958 International Geophysical Year coincided with
a large El Niño, allowing a remarkable set of observations of
the phenomenon. A decade later, a mechanism was presented
that connected Walker’s observations to El Niño (Bjerknes,
1969). This mechanism involved the interaction, through the
SST fi eld, between the east-west atmospheric circulation of
which Walker’s Southern Oscillation was an indicator (Bjerknes
appropriately referred to this as the ‘Walker Circulation’) and
variability in the pool of equatorial warm water of the Pacifi c
Ocean. Observations made in the 1970s (e.g., Wyrtki, 1975)
showed that prior to ENSO warm phases, the sea level in the
western Pacifi c often rises signifi cantly. By the mid-1980s,
after an unusually disruptive El Niño struck in 1982 and 1983,
an observing system (the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere
(TOGA) array; see McPhaden et al., 1998) had been put in
place to monitor ENSO. The resulting data confi rmed the idea
that the phenomenon was inherently one involving coupled
atmosphere-ocean interactions and yielded much-needed
detailed observational insights. By 1986, the fi rst experimental
ENSO forecasts were made (Cane et al., 1986; Zebiak and
Cane, 1987).
The mechanisms and predictive skill of ENSO are still
under discussion. In particular, it is not clear how ENSO
changes with, and perhaps interacts with, a changing climate.
The TAR states ‘...increasing evidence suggests the ENSO
plays a fundamental role in global climate and its interannual
variability, and increased credibility in both regional and global
climate projections will be gained once realistic ENSOs and
their changes are simulated’.
Just as the phenomenon of El Niño has been familiar to the
people of tropical South America for centuries, a spatial pattern
affecting climate variability in the North Atlantic has similarly
been known by the people of Northern Europe for a long time.
The Danish missionary Hans Egede made the following well-
known diary entry in the mid-18th century: ‘In Greenland,
all winters are severe, yet they are not alike. The Danes have
noticed that when the winter in Denmark was severe, as we
perceive it, the winter in Greenland in its manner was mild, and
conversely’ (van Loon and Rogers, 1978).
Teisserenc de Bort, Hann, Exner, Defant and Walker all
contributed to the discovery of the underlying dynamic structure.
Walker, in his studies in the Indian Ocean, actually studied global
maps of sea level pressure correlations, and named not only the
Southern Oscillation, but also a Northern Oscillation, which he
subsequently divided into a North Pacifi c and a North Atlantic
Oscillation (Walker, 1924). However, it was Exner (1913, 1924)
who made the fi rst correlation maps showing the spatial structure
in the NH, where the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern
stands out clearly as a north-south oscillation in atmospheric
mass with centres of action near Iceland and Portugal.
The NAO signifi cantly affects weather and climate,
ecosystems and human activities of the North Atlantic sector.
But what is the underlying mechanism? The recognition that
the NAO is associated with variability and latitudinal shifts in
the westerly fl ow of the jet stream originates with the works of
112
Chapter 1
Willett, Namias, Lorenz, Rossby and others in the 1930s, 1940s
and 1950s (reviewed by Stephenson et al., 2003). Because
atmospheric planetary waves are hemispheric in nature, changes
in one region are often connected with changes in other regions,
a phenomenon dubbed ‘teleconnection’ (Wallace and Gutzler,
1981).
The NAO may be partly described as a high-frequency
stochastic process internal to the atmosphere. This understanding
is evidenced by numerous atmosphere-only model simulations.
It is also considered an expression of one of Earth’s ‘annular
modes’ (See Chapter 3). It is, however, the low-frequency
variability of this phenomenon (Hurrell, 1995) that fuels
continued investigations by climate scientists. The long time
scales are the indication of potential predictive skill in the NAO.
The mechanisms responsible for the correspondingly long
‘memory’ are still debated, although they are likely to have a
local or remote oceanic origin. Bjerknes (1964) recognised the
connection between the NAO index (which he referred to as the
‘zonal index’) and sea surface conditions. He speculated that
ocean heat advection could play a role on longer time scales.
The circulation of the Atlantic Ocean is radically different
from that of the Indian and Pacifi c Oceans, in that the MOC is
strongest in the Atlantic with warm water fl owing northwards,
even south of the equator, and cold water returning at depth. It
would therefore not be surprising if the oceanic contributions to
the NAO and to the Southern Oscillation were different.
Earth’s climate is characterised by many modes of variability,
involving both the atmosphere and ocean, and also the
cryosphere and biosphere. Understanding the physical processes
involved in producing low-frequency variability is crucial
for improving scientists’ ability to accurately predict climate
change and for allowing the separation of anthropogenic and
natural variability, thereby improving the ability to detect and
attribute anthropogenic climate change. One central question
for climate scientists, addressed in particular in Chapter 9, is to
determine how human activities infl uence the dynamic nature
of Earth’s climate, and to identify what would have happened
without any human infl uence at all.
1.5 Examples of Progress in
Modelling the Climate
1.5.1 Model Evolution and Model Hierarchies
Climate scenarios rely upon the use of numerical models.
The continuous evolution of these models over recent decades
has been enabled by a considerable increase in computational
capacity, with supercomputer speeds increasing by roughly
a factor of a million in the three decades from the 1970s to
the present. This computational progress has permitted a
corresponding increase in model complexity (by including
more and more components and processes, as depicted in Figure
1.2), in the length of the simulations, and in spatial resolution,
Chapter 1 Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
as shown in Figure 1.4. The models used to evaluate future
climate changes have therefore evolved over time. Most of the
pioneering work on CO2-induced climate change was based on
atmospheric general circulation models coupled to simple ‘slab’
ocean models (i.e., models omitting ocean dynamics), from the
early work of Manabe and Wetherald (1975) to the review of
Schlesinger and Mitchell (1987). At the same time the physical
content of the models has become more comprehensive (see
in Section 1.5.2 the example of clouds). Similarly, most of the
results presented in the FAR were from atmospheric models,
rather than from models of the coupled climate system, and were
used to analyse changes in the equilibrium climate resulting
from a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Current
climate projections can investigate time-dependent scenarios of
climate evolution and can make use of much more complex
coupled ocean-atmosphere models, sometimes even including
interactive chemical or biochemical components.
A parallel evolution toward increased complexity and
resolution has occurred in the domain of numerical weather
prediction, and has resulted in a large and verifi able improvement
in operational weather forecast quality. This example alone
shows that present models are more realistic than were those of
a decade ago. There is also, however, a continuing awareness
that models do not provide a perfect simulation of reality,
because resolving all important spatial or time scales remains
far beyond current capabilities, and also because the behaviour
of such a complex nonlinear system may in general be chaotic.
It has been known since the work of Lorenz (1963) that even
simple models may display intricate behaviour because of their
nonlinearities. The inherent nonlinear behaviour of the climate
system appears in climate simulations at all time scales (Ghil,
1989). In fact, the study of nonlinear dynamical systems has
become important for a wide range of scientifi c disciplines, and
the corresponding mathematical developments are essential to
interdisciplinary studies. Simple models of ocean-atmosphere
interactions, climate-biosphere interactions or climate-economy
interactions may exhibit a similar behaviour, characterised by
partial unpredictability, bifurcations and transition to chaos.
In addition, many of the key processes that control climate
sensitivity or abrupt climate changes (e.g., clouds, vegetation,
oceanic convection) depend on very small spatial scales. They
cannot be represented in full detail in the context of global
models, and scientifi c understanding of them is still notably
incomplete. Consequently, there is a continuing need to assist
in the use and interpretation of complex models through models
that are either conceptually simpler, or limited to a number of
processes or to a specifi c region, therefore enabling a deeper
understanding of the processes at work or a more relevant
comparison with observations. With the development of
computer capacities, simpler models have not disappeared; on
the contrary, a stronger emphasis has been given to the concept
of a ‘hierarchy of models’ as the only way to provide a linkage
between theoretical understanding and the complexity of
realistic models (Held, 2005).
The list of these ‘simpler’ models is very long. Simplicity
may lie in the reduced number of equations (e.g., a single
Figure 1.4. Geographic resolution characteristic of the generations of climate
models used in the IPCC Assessment Reports: FAR (IPCC, 1990), SAR (IPCC, 1996),
TAR (IPCC, 2001a), and AR4 (2007). The fi gures above show how successive genera-
tions of these global models increasingly resolved northern Europe. These illustra-
tions are representative of the most detailed horizontal resolution used for short-term
climate simulations. The century-long simulations cited in IPCC Assessment Reports
after the FAR were typically run with the previous generation’s resolution. Vertical
resolution in both atmosphere and ocean models is not shown, but it has increased
comparably with the horizontal resolution, beginning typically with a single-layer slab
ocean and ten atmospheric layers in the FAR and progressing to about thirty levels in
both atmosphere and ocean.
113
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science equation for the global surface temperature); in the reduced
dimensionality of the problem (one-dimension vertical, one-
dimension latitudinal, two-dimension); or in the restriction
to a few processes (e.g., a mid-latitude quasi-geostrophic
atmosphere with or without the inclusion of moist processes).
The notion of model hierarchy is also linked to the idea of scale:
global circulation models are complemented by regional models
that exhibit a higher resolution over a given area, or process
oriented models, such as cloud resolving models or large eddy
simulations. Earth Models of Intermediate Complexity are used
to investigate long time scales, such as those corresponding to
glacial to interglacial oscillations (Berger et al., 1998). This
distinction between models according to scale is evolving
quickly, driven by the increase in computer capacities. For
example, global models explicitly resolving the dynamics of
convective clouds may soon become computationally feasible.
Many important scientifi c debates in recent years have had
their origin in the use of conceptually simple models. The
study of idealised atmospheric representations of the tropical
climate, for example by Pierrehumbert (1995) who introduced
a separate representation of the areas with ascending and
subsiding circulation in the tropics, has signifi cantly improved
the understanding of the feedbacks that control climate. Simple
linearized models of the atmospheric circulation have been
used to investigate potential new feedback effects. Ocean
box models have played an important role in improving the
understanding of the possible slowing down of the Atlantic
thermohaline circulation (Birchfi eld et al., 1990), as emphasized
in the TAR. Simple models have also played a central role in the
interpretation of IPCC scenarios: the investigation of climate
scenarios presented in the SAR or the TAR has been extended
to larger ensembles of cases using idealised models.
1.5.2 Model Clouds and Climate Sensitivity
The modelling of cloud processes and feedbacks provides
a striking example of the irregular pace of progress in climate
science. Representation of clouds may constitute the area
in which atmospheric models have been modifi ed most
continuously to take into account increasingly complex physical
processes. At the time of the TAR clouds remained a major
source of uncertainty in the simulation of climate changes (as
they still are at present: e.g., Sections 2.4, 2.6, 3.4.3, 7.5, 8.2,
8.4.11, 8.6.2.2, 8.6.3.2, 9.2.1.2, 9.4.1.8, 10.2.1.2, 10.3.2.2,
10.5.4.3, 11.8.1.3, 11.8.2.2).
In the early 1980s, most models were still using prescribed
cloud amounts, as functions of location and altitude, and
prescribed cloud radiative properties, to compute atmospheric
radiation. The cloud amounts were very often derived from the
zonally averaged climatology of London (1957). Succeeding
generations of models have used relative humidity or other
simple predictors to diagnose cloudiness (Slingo, 1987), thus
providing a foundation of increased realism for the models,
but at the same time possibly causing inconsistencies in
the representation of the multiple roles of clouds as bodies
interacting with radiation, generating precipitation and
114
Chapter 1
infl uencing small-scale convective or turbulent circulations.
Following the pioneering studies of Sundqvist (1978), an explicit
representation of clouds was progressively introduced into
climate models, beginning in the late 1980s. Models fi rst used
simplifi ed representations of cloud microphysics, following,
for example, Kessler (1969), but more recent generations of
models generally incorporate a much more comprehensive and
detailed representation of clouds, based on consistent physical
principles. Comparisons of model results with observational
data presented in the TAR have shown that, based on zonal
averages, the representation of clouds in most climate models
was also more realistic in 2000 than had been the case only a
few years before.
In spite of this undeniable progress, the amplitude and
even the sign of cloud feedbacks was noted in the TAR as
highly uncertain, and this uncertainty was cited as one of the
key factors explaining the spread in model simulations of
future climate for a given emission scenario. This cannot be
regarded as a surprise: that the sensitivity of the Earth’s climate
to changing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations must
depend strongly on cloud feedbacks can be illustrated on the
simplest theoretical grounds, using data that have been available
for a long time. Satellite measurements have indeed provided
meaningful estimates of Earth’s radiation budget since the early
1970s (Vonder Haar and Suomi, 1971). Clouds, which cover
about 60% of the Earth’s surface, are responsible for up to two-
thirds of the planetary albedo, which is about 30%. An albedo
decrease of only 1%, bringing the Earth’s albedo from 30%
to 29%, would cause an increase in the black-body radiative
equilibrium temperature of about 1°C, a highly signifi cant value,
roughly equivalent to the direct radiative effect of a doubling
of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Simultaneously, clouds
make an important contribution to the planetary greenhouse
effect. In addition, changes in cloud cover constitute only one
of the many parameters that affect cloud radiative interactions:
cloud optical thickness, cloud height and cloud microphysical
properties can also be modifi ed by atmospheric temperature
changes, which adds to the complexity of feedbacks, as
evidenced, for example, through satellite observations analysed
by Tselioudis and Rossow (1994).
The importance of simulated cloud feedbacks was revealed
by the analysis of model results (Manabe and Wetherald,
1975; Hansen et al, 1984), and the fi rst extensive model
intercomparisons (Cess et al., 1989) also showed a substantial
model dependency. The strong effect of cloud processes on
climate model sensitivities to greenhouse gases was emphasized
further through a now-classic set of General Circulation Model
(GCM) experiments, carried out by Senior and Mitchell (1993).
They produced global average surface temperature changes
(due to doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration) ranging from
1.9°C to 5.4°C, simply by altering the way that cloud radiative
properties were treated in the model. It is somewhat unsettling
that the results of a complex climate model can be so drastically
altered by substituting one reasonable cloud parametrization
for another, thereby approximately replicating the overall inter-
model range of sensitivities. Other GCM groups have also

Frequently Asked Question 1.3
What is the Greenhouse Effect?
The Sun powers Earth’s climate, radiating energy at very short
wavelengths, predominately in the visible or near-visible (e.g., ul-
traviolet) part of the spectrum. Roughly one-third of the solar
energy that reaches the top of Earth’s atmosphere is refl ected di-
rectly back to space. The remaining two-thirds is absorbed by the
surface and, to a lesser extent, by the atmosphere. To balance the
absorbed incoming energy, the Earth must, on average, radiate the
same amount of energy back to space. Because the Earth is much
colder than the Sun, it radiates at much longer wavelengths, pri-
marily in the infrared part of the spectrum (see Figure 1). Much
of this thermal radiation emitted by the land and ocean is ab-
sorbed by the atmosphere, including clouds, and reradiated back
to Earth. This is called the greenhouse effect. The glass walls in
a greenhouse reduce airfl ow and increase the temperature of the
air inside. Analogously, but through a different physical process,
the Earth’s greenhouse effect warms the surface of the planet.
Without the natural greenhouse effect, the average temperature at
Earth’s surface would be below the freezing point of water. Thus,
Earth’s natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it pos-
sible. However, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil
fuels and clearing of forests, have greatly intensifi ed the natural
greenhouse effect, causing global warming.
The two most abundant gases in the atmosphere, nitrogen
(comprising 78% of the dry atmosphere) and oxygen (comprising
21%), exert almost no greenhouse effect. Instead, the greenhouse
effect comes from molecules that are more complex and much less
common. Water vapour is the most important greenhouse gas, and
carbon dioxide (CO2) is the second-most important one. Methane,
nitrous oxide, ozone and several other gases present in the atmo-
sphere in small amounts also contribute to the greenhouse effect.
In the humid equatorial regions, where there is so much water
vapour in the air that the greenhouse effect is very large, add-
ing a small additional amount of CO2 or water vapour has only a
small direct impact on downward infrared radiation. However, in
the cold, dry polar regions, the effect of a small increase in CO2 or

Historical Overview of Climate Change Science water vapour is much greater. The same is true for the cold, dry
upper atmosphere where a small increase in water vapour has a
greater infl uence on the greenhouse effect than the same change
in water vapour would have near the surface.
Several components of the climate system, notably the oceans
and living things, affect atmospheric concentrations of green-
house gases. A prime example of this is plants taking CO2 out of
the atmosphere and converting it (and water) into carbohydrates
via photosynthesis. In the industrial era, human activities have
added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, primarily through the
burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests.
Adding more of a greenhouse gas, such as CO2, to the at-
mosphere intensifi es the greenhouse effect, thus warming Earth’s
climate. The amount of warming depends on various feedback
mechanisms. For example, as the atmosphere warms due to rising
levels of greenhouse gases, its concentration of water vapour
consistently obtained widely varying results by trying other
techniques of incorporating cloud microphysical processes and
their radiative interactions (e.g., Roeckner et al., 1987; Le Treut
and Li, 1991), which differed from the approach of Senior and
Mitchell (1993) through the treatment of partial cloudiness or
mixed-phase properties. The model intercomparisons presented
in the TAR showed no clear resolution of this unsatisfactory
situation.
The scientifi c community realised long ago that using
adequate data to constrain models was the only way to solve this
problem. Using climate changes in the distant past to constrain
the amplitude of cloud feedback has defi nite limitations
(Ramstein et al., 1998). The study of cloud changes at decadal,
interannual or seasonal time scales therefore remains a necessary
path to constrain models. A long history of cloud observations
now runs parallel to that of model development. Operational
ground-based measurements, carried out for the purpose of
weather prediction, constitute a valuable source of information
that has been gathered and analysed by Warren et al. (1986,
1988). The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project
(ISCCP; Rossow and Schiffer, 1991) has developed an analysis
of cloud cover and cloud properties using the measurements
of operational meteorological satellites over a period of more
than two decades. These data have been complemented by
other satellite remote sensing data sets, such as those associated
with the Nimbus-7 Temperature Humidity Infrared Radiometer
(THIR) instrument (Stowe et al., 1988), with high-resolution
spectrometers such as the High Resolution Infrared Radiation
Sounder (HIRS) (Susskind et al., 1987), and with microwave
absorption, as used by the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager
(SSM/I). Chapter 8 provides an update of this ongoing
observational effort.
A parallel effort has been carried out to develop a wider
range of ground-based measurements, not only to provide an

increases, further intensifying the greenhouse effect. This in turn
causes more warming, which causes an additional increase in
water vapour, in a self-reinforcing cycle. This water vapour feed-
back may be strong enough to approximately double the increase
in the greenhouse effect due to the added CO2 alone.
Additional important feedback mechanisms involve clouds.
Clouds are effective at absorbing infrared radiation and therefore
exert a large greenhouse effect, thus warming the Earth. Clouds
are also effective at refl ecting away incoming solar radiation, thus
cooling the Earth. A change in almost any aspect of clouds, such
as their type, location, water content, cloud altitude, particle size
and shape, or lifetimes, affects the degree to which clouds warm
or cool the Earth. Some changes amplify warming while others
diminish it. Much research is in progress to better understand how
clouds change in response to climate warming, and how these
changes affect climate through various feedback mechanisms.
adequate reference for satellite observations, but also to make
possible a detailed and empirically based analysis of the entire
range of space and time scales involved in cloud processes.
The longest-lasting and most comprehensive effort has been
the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program
in the USA, which has established elaborately instrumented
observational sites to monitor the full complexity of cloud
systems on a long-term basis (Ackerman and Stokes, 2003).
Shorter fi eld campaigns dedicated to the observation of specifi c
phenomena have also been established, such as the TOGA
Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE)
for convective systems (Webster and Lukas, 1992), or the
Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) for
stratocumulus (Albrecht et al., 1995).
Observational data have clearly helped the development of
models. The ISCCP data have greatly aided the development
of cloud representations in climate models since the mid-1980s
(e.g., Le Treut and Li, 1988; Del Genio et al., 1996). However,
existing data have not yet brought about any reduction in the
existing range of simulated cloud feedbacks. More recently,
new theoretical tools have been developed to aid in validating
parametrizations in a mode that emphasizes the role of cloud
processes participating in climatic feedbacks. One such approach
has been to focus on comprehensively observed episodes of
cloudiness for which the large-scale forcing is observationally
known, using single-column models (Randall et al., 1996;
Somerville, 2000) and higher-resolution cloud-resolving
models to evaluate GCM parametrizations. Another approach
is to make use of the more global and continuous satellite data,
on a statistical basis, through an investigation of the correlation
between climate forcing and cloud parameters (Bony et al.,
1997), in such a way as to provide a test of feedbacks between
different climate variables. Chapter 8 assesses recent progress
in this area.

concentrations, spoke of a range of global mean equilibrium
surface temperature increase of between 1.5°C and 4.5°C, a
range that has remained part of conventional wisdom at least as
recently as the TAR. These climate projections, as well as those
treated later in the comparison of three models by Schlesinger
and Mitchell (1987) and most of those presented in the FAR,
were the results of atmospheric models coupled with simple
‘slab’ ocean models (i.e., models omitting all changes in ocean
dynamics).
The fi rst attempts at coupling atmospheric and oceanic
models were carried out during the late 1960s and early 1970s
(Manabe and Bryan, 1969; Bryan et al., 1975; Manabe et al.,
1975). Replacing ‘slab’ ocean models by fully coupled ocean-
atmosphere models may arguably have constituted one of the
most signifi cant leaps forward in climate modelling during the
last 20 years (Trenberth, 1993), although both the atmospheric
and oceanic components themselves have undergone highly
signifi cant improvements. This advance has led to signifi cant
modifi cations in the patterns of simulated climate change,
particularly in oceanic regions. It has also opened up the
possibility of exploring transient climate scenarios, and it
constitutes a step toward the development of comprehensive
‘Earth-system models’ that include explicit representations of
chemical and biogeochemical cycles.
Throughout their short history, coupled models have faced
diffi culties that have considerably impeded their development,
including: (i) the initial state of the ocean is not precisely known;
(ii) a surface fl ux imbalance (in either energy, momentum or
fresh water) much smaller than the observational accuracy is
enough to cause a drifting of coupled GCM simulations into
unrealistic states; and (iii) there is no direct stabilising feedback
that can compensate for any errors in the simulated salinity. The
strong emphasis placed on the realism of the simulated base
state provided a rationale for introducing ‘fl ux adjustments’ or
‘fl ux corrections’ (Manabe and Stouffer, 1988; Sausen et al.,
1988) in early simulations. These were essentially empirical
corrections that could not be justifi ed on physical principles,
and that consisted of arbitrary additions of surface fl uxes of
heat and salinity in order to prevent the drift of the simulated
climate away from a realistic state. The National Center for
Atmospheric Research model may have been the fi rst to realise
non-fl ux-corrected coupled simulations systematically, and it
was able to achieve simulations of climate change into the 21st
century, in spite of a persistent drift that still affected many of
its early simulations. Both the FAR and the SAR pointed out the
apparent need for fl ux adjustments as a problematic feature of
climate modelling (Cubasch et al., 1990; Gates et al., 1996).
By the time of the TAR, however, the situation had evolved,
and about half the coupled GCMs assessed in the TAR did not
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
employ fl ux adjustments. That report noted that ‘some non-fl ux-
adjusted models are now able to maintain stable climatologies
of comparable quality to fl ux-adjusted models’ (McAvaney et
al., 2001). Since that time, evolution away from fl ux correction
(or fl ux adjustment) has continued at some modelling centres,
although a number of state-of-the-art models continue to rely on
it. The design of the coupled model simulations is also strongly
linked with the methods chosen for model initialisation. In fl ux-
adjusted models, the initial ocean state is necessarily the result
of preliminary and typically thousand-year-long simulations
to bring the ocean model into equilibrium. Non-fl ux-adjusted
models often employ a simpler procedure based on ocean
observations, such as those compiled by Levitus et al. (1994),
although some spin-up phase is even then necessary. One
argument brought forward is that non-adjusted models made
use of ad hoc tuning of radiative parameters (i.e., an implicit
fl ux adjustment).
This considerable advance in model design has not
diminished the existence of a range of model results. This is not
a surprise, however, because it is known that climate predictions
are intrinsically affected by uncertainty (Lorenz, 1963). Two
distinct kinds of prediction problems were defi ned by Lorenz
(1975). The fi rst kind was defi ned as the prediction of the actual
properties of the climate system in response to a given initial
state. Predictions of the fi rst kind are initial-value problems
and, because of the nonlinearity and instability of the governing
equations, such systems are not predictable indefi nitely into the
future. Predictions of the second kind deal with the determination
of the response of the climate system to changes in the external
forcings. These predictions are not concerned directly with the
chronological evolution of the climate state, but rather with
the long-term average of the statistical properties of climate.
Originally, it was thought that predictions of the second kind do
not at all depend on initial conditions. Instead, they are intended
to determine how the statistical properties of the climate system
(e.g., the average annual global mean temperature, or the
expected number of winter storms or hurricanes, or the average
monsoon rainfall) change as some external forcing parameter,
for example CO2 content, is altered. Estimates of future climate
scenarios as a function of the concentration of atmospheric
greenhouse gases are typical examples of predictions of the
second kind. However, ensemble simulations show that the
projections tend to form clusters around a number of attractors
as a function of their initial state (see Chapter 10).
Uncertainties in climate predictions (of the second kind)
arise mainly from model uncertainties and errors. To assess
and disentangle these effects, the scientifi c community has
organised a series of systematic comparisons of the different
existing models, and it has worked to achieve an increase in
the number and range of simulations being carried out in order
to more fully explore the factors affecting the accuracy of the
simulations.
An early example of systematic comparison of models
is provided by Cess et al. (1989), who compared results of
documented differences among model simulations in their
117
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science representation of cloud feedback to show how the consequent
effects on atmospheric radiation resulted in different model
response to doubling of the CO2 concentration. A number of
ambitious and comprehensive ‘model intercomparison projects’
(MIPs) were set up in the 1990s under the auspices of the World
Climate Research Programme to undertake controlled conditions
for model evaluation. One of the fi rst was the Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP), which studied atmospheric
GCMs. The development of coupled models induced the
development of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP), which studied coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs and
their response to idealised forcings, such as a 1% yearly increase
in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. It proved important in
carrying out the various MIPs to standardise the model forcing
parameters and the model output so that fi le formats, variable
names, units, etc., are easily recognised by data users. The fact
that the model results were stored separately and independently
of the modelling centres, and that the analysis of the model
output was performed mainly by research groups independent
of the modellers, has added confi dence in the results. Summary
diagnostic products such as the Taylor (2001) diagram were
developed for MIPs.
The establishment of the AMIP and CMIP projects opened
a new era for climate modelling, setting standards of quality
control, providing organisational continuity and ensuring that
results are generally reproducible. Results from AMIP have
provided a number of insights into climate model behaviour
(Gates et al., 1999) and quantifi ed improved agreement between
simulated and observed atmospheric properties as new versions
of models are developed. In general, results of the MIPs suggest
that the most problematic areas of coupled model simulations
involve cloud-radiation processes, the cryosphere, the deep
ocean and ocean-atmosphere interactions.
Comparing different models is not suffi cient, however. Using
multiple simulations from a single model (the so-called Monte
Carlo, or ensemble, approach) has proved a necessary and
complementary approach to assess the stochastic nature of the
climate system. The fi rst ensemble climate change simulations
with global GCMs used a set of different initial and boundary
conditions (Cubasch et al., 1994; Barnett, 1995). Computational
constraints limited early ensembles to a relatively small number
of samples (fewer than 10). These ensemble simulations clearly
indicated that even with a single model a large spread in the
climate projections can be obtained.
Intercomparison of existing models and ensemble model
studies (i.e., those involving many integrations of the same
model) are still undergoing rapid development. Running
ensembles was essentially impossible until recent advances in
computer power occurred, as these systematic comprehensive
climate model studies are exceptionally demanding on computer
resources. Their progress has marked the evolution from the
FAR to the TAR, and is likely to continue in the years to come.

1.6 The IPCC Assessments of Climate
Change and Uncertainties
The WMO and the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) established the IPCC in 1988 with the assigned
role of assessing the scientifi c, technical and socioeconomic
information relevant for understanding the risk of human-
induced climate change. The original 1988 mandate for the
IPCC was extensive: ‘(a) Identifi cation of uncertainties and
gaps in our present knowledge with regard to climate changes
and its potential impacts, and preparation of a plan of action
over the short-term in fi lling these gaps; (b) Identifi cation of
information needed to evaluate policy implications of climate
change and response strategies; (c) Review of current and
planned national/international policies related to the greenhouse
gas issue; (d) Scientifi c and environmental assessments of all
aspects of the greenhouse gas issue and the transfer of these
assessments and other relevant information to governments
and intergovernmental organisations to be taken into account
in their policies on social and economic development and
environmental programs.’ The IPCC is open to all members of
UNEP and WMO. It does not directly support new research or
monitor climate-related data. However, the IPCC process of
synthesis and assessment has often inspired scientifi c research
leading to new fi ndings.
The IPCC has three Working Groups and a Task Force.
Working Group I (WGI) assesses the scientifi c aspects of the
climate system and climate change, while Working Groups II
(WGII) and III (WGIII) assess the vulnerability and adaptation
of socioeconomic and natural systems to climate change, and
the mitigation options for limiting greenhouse gas emissions,
respectively. The Task Force is responsible for the IPCC
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme. This brief
history focuses on WGI and how it has described uncertainty in
the quantities presented (See Box 1.1).
A main activity of the IPCC is to provide on a regular basis
an assessment of the state of knowledge on climate change, and
this volume is the fourth such Assessment Report of WGI. The
IPCC also prepares Special Reports and Technical Papers on
topics for which independent scientifi c information and advice is
deemed necessary, and it supports the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) through its work
on methodologies for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
The FAR played an important role in the discussions of the
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the UNFCCC.
The UNFCCC was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in
1994. It provides the overall policy framework and legal basis
for addressing the climate change issue.
The WGI FAR was completed under the leadership of Bert
Bolin (IPCC Chair) and John Houghton (WGI Chair) in a
plenary at Windsor, UK in May 1990. In a mere 365 pages with
eight colour plates, it made a persuasive, but not quantitative,
case for anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
Most conclusions from the FAR were non-quantitative and
Chapter 1 remain valid today (see also Section 1.4.4). For example, in
terms of the greenhouse gases, ‘emissions resulting from
human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric
concentrations of the greenhouse gases: CO2, CH4, CFCs, N2O’
(see Chapters 2 and 3; Section 7.1). On the other hand, the FAR
did not foresee the phase-out of CFCs, missed the importance
of biomass-burning aerosols and dust to climate and stated
that unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect
was more than a decade away. The latter two areas highlight
the advance of climate science and in particular the merging
of models and observations in the new fi eld of detection and
attribution (see Section 9.1).
The Policymakers Summary of the WGI FAR gave a broad
overview of climate change science and its Executive Summary
separated key fi ndings into areas of varying levels of confi dence
ranging from ‘certainty’ to providing an expert ‘judgment’.
Much of the summary is not quantitative (e.g., the radiative
forcing bar charts do not appear in the summary). Similarly,
scientifi c uncertainty is hardly mentioned; when ranges are
given, as in the projected temperature increases of 0.2°C to
0.5°C per decade, no probability or likelihood is assigned to
explain the range (see Chapter 10). In discussion of the climate
sensitivity to doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration, the
combined subjective and objective criteria are explained: the
range of model results was 1.9°C to 5.2°C; most were close to
4.0°C; but the newer model results were lower; and hence the
best estimate was 2.5°C with a range of 1.5°C to 4.5°C. The
likelihood of the value being within this range was not defi ned.
However, the importance of identifying those areas where
climate scientists had high confi dence was recognised in the
Policymakers Summary.
The Supplementary Report (IPCC, 1992) re-evaluated the
RF values of the FAR and included the new IPCC scenarios for
future emissions, designated IS92a–f. It also included updated
chapters on climate observations and modelling (see Chapters 3,
4, 5, 6 and 8). The treatment of scientifi c uncertainty remained
as in the FAR. For example, the calculated increase in global
mean surface temperature since the 19th century was given as
0.45°C ± 0.15°C, with no quantitative likelihood for this range
(see Section 3.2).
The SAR, under Bert Bolin (IPCC Chair) and John Houghton
and Gylvan Meira Filho (WGI Co-chairs), was planned with
and coupled to a preliminary Special Report (IPCC, 1995) that
contained intensive chapters on the carbon cycle, atmospheric
chemistry, aerosols and radiative forcing. The WGI SAR
culminated in the government plenary in Madrid in November
1995. The most cited fi nding from that plenary, on attribution of
climate change, has been consistently reaffi rmed by subsequent
research: ‘The balance of evidence suggests a discernible
human infl uence on global climate’ (see Chapter 9). The SAR
provided key input to the negotiations that led to the adoption
in 1997 of the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC.
Uncertainty in the WGI SAR was defi ned in a number of
ways. The carbon cycle budgets used symmetric plus/minus
ranges explicitly defi ned as 90% confi dence intervals, whereas
the RF bar chart reported a ‘mid-range’ bar along with a
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
plus/minus range that was estimated largely on the spread of
published values. The likelihood, or confi dence interval, of the
spread of published results was not given. These uncertainties
were additionally modifi ed by a declaration that the confi dence
of the RF being within the specifi ed range was indicated by
a stated confi dence level that ranged from ‘high’ (greenhouse
gases) to ‘very low’ (aerosols). Due to the diffi culty in
approving such a long draft in plenary, the Summary for Policy
Makers (SPM) became a short document with no fi gures and
few numbers. The use of scientifi c uncertainty in the SPM was
thus limited and similar to the FAR: a range in the mean surface
temperature increase since 1900 was given as 0.3°C to 0.6°C
with no explanation as to likelihood of this range. While the
underlying report showed projected future warming for a range
of different climate models, the Technical Summary focused on
a central estimate.
The IPCC Special Report on Aviation and the Global
Atmosphere (IPCC, 1999) was a major interim assessment
involving both WGI and WGIII and the Scientifi c Assessment
Panel to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer. It assessed the impacts of civil aviation in terms
of climate change and global air quality as well as looking
at the effect of technology options for the future fl eet. It was
the fi rst complete assessment of an industrial sub-sector. The
summary related aviation’s role relative to all human infl uence
on the climate system: ‘The best estimate of the radiative
forcing in 1992 by aircraft is 0.05 W m–2 or about 3.5% of
the total radiative forcing by all anthropogenic activities.’ The
authors took a uniform approach to assigning and propagating
uncertainty in these RF values based on mixed objective and
subjective criteria. In addition to a best value, a two-thirds
likelihood (67% confi dence) interval is given. This interval
is similar to a one-sigma (i.e., one standard deviation) normal
error distribution, but it was explicitly noted that the probability
distribution outside this interval was not evaluated and might
not have a normal distribution. A bar chart with ‘whiskers’
(two-thirds likelihood range) showing the components and total
(without cirrus effects) RF for aviation in 1992 appeared in the
SPM (see Sections 2.6 and 10.2).
The TAR, under Robert Watson (IPCC Chair) and John
Houghton and Ding YiHui (WGI Co-chairs), was approved
at the government plenary in Shanghai in January 2001.
The predominant summary statements from the TAR WGI
strengthened the SAR’s attribution statement: ‘An increasing
body of observations gives a collective picture of a warming
world and other changes in the climate system’, and ‘There is
new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed
over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.’ The
TAR Synthesis Report (IPCC, 2001b) combined the assessment
reports from the three Working Groups. By combining data
on global (WGI) and regional (WGII) climate change, the
Synthesis Report was able to strengthen the conclusion
regarding human infl uence: ‘The Earth’s climate system has
demonstrably changed on both global and regional scales since
the pre-industrial era, with some of these changes attributable
to human activities’ (see Chapter 9).

Historical Overview of Climate Change Science Chapter 1
Box 1.1: Treatment of Uncertainties in the Working Group I Assessment
The importance of consistent and transparent treatment of uncertainties is clearly recognised by the IPCC in preparing its assess-
ments of climate change. The increasing attention given to formal treatments of uncertainty in previous assessments is addressed in
Section 1.6. To promote consistency in the general treatment of uncertainty across all three Working Groups, authors of the Fourth
Assessment Report have been asked to follow a brief set of guidance notes on determining and describing uncertainties in the context
of an assessment .1 This box summarises the way that Working Group I has applied those guidelines and covers some aspects of the
treatment of uncertainty specifi c to material assessed here.
Uncertainties can be classifi ed in several diff erent ways according to their origin. Two primary types are ‘value uncertainties’ and
‘structural uncertainties’. Value uncertainties arise from the incomplete determination of particular values or results, for example, when
data are inaccurate or not fully representative of the phenomenon of interest. Structural uncertainties arise from an incomplete un-
derstanding of the processes that control particular values or results, for example, when the conceptual framework or model used
for analysis does not include all the relevant processes or relationships. Value uncertainties are generally estimated using statistical
techniques and expressed probabilistically. Structural uncertainties are generally described by giving the authors’ collective judgment
of their confi dence in the correctness of a result. In both cases, estimating uncertainties is intrinsically about describing the limits to
knowledge and for this reason involves expert judgment about the state of that knowledge. A diff erent type of uncertainty arises
in systems that are either chaotic or not fully deterministic in nature and this also limits our ability to project all aspects of climate
change.
The scientifi c literature assessed here uses a variety of other generic ways of categorising uncertainties. Uncertainties associated
with ‘random errors’ have the characteristic of decreasing as additional measurements are accumulated, whereas those associated
with ‘systematic errors’ do not. In dealing with climate records, considerable attention has been given to the identifi cation of systemat-
ic errors or unintended biases arising from data sampling issues and methods of analysing and combining data. Specialised statistical
methods based on quantitative analysis have been developed for the detection and attribution of climate change and for producing
probabilistic projections of future climate parameters. These are summarised in the relevant chapters.
The uncertainty guidance provided for the Fourth Assessment Report draws, for the fi rst time, a careful distinction between levels
of confi dence in scientifi c understanding and the likelihoods of specifi c results. This allows authors to express high confi dence that an
event is extremely unlikely (e.g., rolling a dice twice and getting a six both times), as well as high confi dence that an event is about as
likely as not (e.g., a tossed coin coming up heads). Confi dence and likelihood as used here are distinct concepts but are often linked
in practice.
The standard terms used to defi ne levels of confi dence in this report are as given in the IPCC Uncertainty Guidance Note, namely:
Confi dence Terminology Degree of confi dence in being correct
Very high confi dence High confi dence Medium confi dence Low confi dence Very low confi dence At least 9 out of 10 chance
About 8 out of 10 chance
About 5 out of 10 chance
About 2 out of 10 chance
Less than 1 out of 10 chance
Note that ‘low confi dence’ and ‘very low confi dence’ are only used for areas of major concern and where a risk-based perspective
is justifi ed.
Chapter 2 of this report uses a related term ‘level of scientifi c understanding’ when describing uncertainties in diff erent contribu-
tions to radiative forcing. This terminology is used for consistency with the Third Assessment Report, and the basis on which the au-
thors have determined particular levels of scientifi c understanding uses a combination of approaches consistent with the uncertainty
guidance note as explained in detail in Section 2.9.2 and Table 2.11.

Chapter 1 Historical Overview of Climate Change Science
The standard terms used in this report to defi ne the likelihood of an outcome or result where this can be estimated
probabilistically are:
Likelihood Terminology Likelihood of the occurrence/ outcome
Virtually certain > 99% probability
Extremely likely > 95% probability
Very likely > 90% probability
Likely > 66% probability
More likely than not > 50% probability
About as likely as not 33 to 66% probability
Unlikely < 33% probability
Very unlikely < 10% probability
Extremely unlikely < 5% probability
Exceptionally unlikely < 1% probability
The terms ‘extremely likely’, ‘extremely unlikely’ and ‘more likely than not’ as defi ned above have been added to those given in
the IPCC Uncertainty Guidance Note in order to provide a more specifi c assessment of aspects including attribution and radiative
forcing.
Unless noted otherwise, values given in this report are assessed best estimates and their uncertainty ranges are 90% confi dence
intervals (i.e., there is an estimated 5% likelihood of the value being below the lower end of the range or above the upper end of the
range). Note that in some cases the nature of the constraints on a value, or other information available, may indicate an asymmetric
distribution of the uncertainty range around a best estimate.
In an effort to promote consistency, a guidance paper on
uncertainty (Moss and Schneider, 2000) was distributed to all
Working Group authors during the drafting of the TAR. The
WGI TAR made some effort at consistency, noting in the SPM
that when ranges were given they generally denoted 95%
confi dence intervals, although the carbon budget uncertainties
were specifi ed as ±1 standard deviation (68% likelihood). The
range of 1.5°C to 4.5°C for climate sensitivity to atmospheric
CO2 doubling was reiterated but with no confi dence assigned;
however, it was clear that the level of scientifi c understanding
had increased since that same range was fi rst given in the
Charney et al. (1979) report. The RF bar chart noted that the
RF components could not be summed (except for the long-
lived greenhouse gases) and that the ‘whiskers’ on the RF bars
each meant something different (e.g., some were the range of
models, some were uncertainties). Another failure in dealing
with uncertainty was the projection of 21st-century warming:
it was reported as a range covering (i) six Special Report on
Emission Scenarios (SRES) emissions scenarios and (ii) nine
atmosphere-ocean climate models using two grey envelopes
without estimates of likelihood levels. The full range (i.e.,
scenario plus climate model range) of 1.4°C to 5.8°C is a
much-cited fi nding of the WGI TAR but the lack of discussion
of associated likelihood in the report makes the interpretation
and useful application of this result diffi cult.
1.7 Summary
As this chapter shows, the history of the centuries-long effort
to document and understand climate change is often complex,
marked by successes and failures, and has followed a very uneven
pace. Testing scientifi c fi ndings and openly discussing the test
results have been the key to the remarkable progress that is now
accelerating in all domains, in spite of inherent limitations to
predictive capacity. Climate change science is now contributing
to the foundation of a new interdisciplinary approach to
understanding our environment. Consequently, much published
research and many notable scientifi c advances have occurred
since the TAR, including advances in the understanding and
treatment of uncertainty. Key aspects of recent climate change
research are assessed in Chapters 2 through 11 of this report.

 I have wished a bird would fly away,
And not sing by my house all day;

Have clapped my hands at him from the door
When it seemed as if I could bear no more.

The fault must partly have been in me.
The bird was not to blame for his key.

And of course there must be something wrong
In wanting to silence any song.

He halted in the wind, and â€” what was that
Far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost?
He stood there bringing March against his thought,
And yet too ready to believe the most.

"Oh, that's the Paradise-in-bloom," I said;
And truly it was fair enough for flowers
had we but in us to assume in march
Such white luxuriance of May for ours.

We stood a moment so in a strange world,
Myself as one his own pretense deceives;
And then I said the truth (and we moved on).
A young beech clinging to its last year's leaves.

The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square
With the new city street it has to wear
A number in. But what about the brook
That held the house as in an elbow-crook?
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength
And impulse, having dipped a finger length
And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed
A flower to try its currents where they crossed.
The meadow grass could be cemented down
From growing under pavements of a town;
The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.
Is water wood to serve a brook the same?
How else dispose of an immortal force
No longer needed? Staunch it at its source
With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown
Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone
In fetid darkness still to live and run â€”
And all for nothing it had ever done
Except forget to go in fear perhaps.
No one would know except for ancient maps
That such a brook ran water. But I wonder
If from its being kept forever under,
The thoughts may not have risen that so keep
This new-built city from both work and sleep.

MIST- I don't believe the sleepers in the house know where they are.
SMOKE- They've been here long enough to push the woods back from around the house and part them in the middle with a path.
MIST- And still I doubt if they know where they are. And I begin to fear they never will. All they maintain the path for is the comfort of visiting with the equally bewildered. Nearer in plight their neighbors are than distance.
SMOKE- I am the guardian wraith of starlit smoke that leans out this and that way from their chimney. I will not have their happiness despaired of.
MIST- No one - not I would give them up for lost simply because they don't know where they are.  I am the damper counterpart of smoke that gives off from a garden ground at night. But lifts no higher than a garden grows. I cotton to their landscape. That's who I am. I am no further from their fate than you are
SMOKE- They must by now have learned the native tongue. Why don't they ask the red man where they are?
MIST - They often do, and none the wiser for it. So do they also ask philosophers who come to look in on them from the pulpit. They will ask anyone there is to ask - In the fond faith accumulated fact - will of itself take fire

religion.
SMOKE - If the day ever comes when they know who they are, they may know better where they are. But who they are is too much to believe - either for them or the onlooking world. They are too sudden to be credible.
MIST - Listen, they murmur talking in the dark on what
should be their daylong theme continued. Putting the lamp out has not put their thought out. Let us pretend the dewdrops from the leaves are you, and I evesdropping on their unrest - a mist and smoke evesdropping on a haze - And see if we can tell the bass from the soprano.

There sandy seems the golden sky
And golden seems the sandy plain.
No habitation meets the eye
Unless in the horizon rim,
Some halfway up the limestone wall,
That spot of black is not a stain
Or shadow, but a cavern hole,
Where someone used to climb and crawl
To rest from his besetting fears.
I see the callus on his soul
The disappearing last of him
And of his race starvation slim,
Oh years ago - ten thousand years.

I had withdrawn in forest, and my song
Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway;
And to the forest edge you came one day
(This was my dream) and looked and pondered long,
But did not enter, though the wish was strong:
You shook your pensive head as who should say,
â€ ̃I dare notâ€”too far in his footsteps strayâ€”
He must seek me would he undo the wrong.

Not far, but near, I stood and saw it all
Behind low boughs the trees let down outside;
And the sweet pang it cost me not to call
And tell you that I saw does still abide.
But 'tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof,
For the wood wakes, and you are here for proof.

Old Davis owned a solid mica mountain
In Dalton that would someday make his fortune.
There'd been some Boston people out to see it:
And experts said that deep down in the mountain
The mica sheets were big as plate-glass windows.
He'd like to take me there and show it to me.

'I'll tell you what you show me. You remember
You said you knew the place where once, on Kinsman,
The early Mormons made a settlement
And built a stone baptismal font outdoors-
But Smith, or someone, called them off the mountain
To go West to a worse fight with the desert.
You said you'd seen the stone baptismal font.
Well, take me there.'

Someday I will.'

'Today.'

'Huh, that old bathtub, what is that to see?
Let's talk about it.'

'Let's go see the place.'

'To shut you up I'll tell you what I'll do:
I'll find that fountain if it takes all summer,
And both of our united strengths, to do it.'

'You've lost it, then?'

'Not so but I can find it.
No doubt it's grown up some to woods around it.
The mountain may have shifted since I saw it
In eighty-five.'

'As long ago as that?'

'If I remember rightly, it had sprung
A leak and emptied then. And forty years
Can do a good deal to bad masonry.
You won't see any Mormon swimming in it.
But you have said it, and we're off to find it.
Old as I am, I'm going to let myself
Be dragged by you all over everywhere- '
'I thought you were a guide.'

'I am a guide,
And that's why I can't decently refuse you.'

We made a day of it out of the world,
Ascending to descend to reascend.
The old man seriously took his bearings,
And spoke his doubts in every open place.

We came out on a look-off where we faced
A cliff, and on the cliff a bottle painted,
Or stained by vegetation from above,
A likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist.

'Well, if I haven't brought you to the fountain,
At least I've brought you to the famous Bottle.'

'I won't accept the substitute. It's empty.'

'So's everything.'

'I want my fountain.'

'I guess you'd find the fountain just as empty.
And anyway this tells me where I am.'

'Hadn't you long suspected where you were?'

'You mean miles from that Mormon settlement?
Look here, you treat your guide with due respect
If you don't want to spend the night outdoors.
I vow we must be near the place from where
The two converging slides, the avalanches,
On Marshall, look like donkey's ears.
We may as well see that and save the day.'

'Don't donkey's ears suggest we shake our own?'

'For God's sake, aren't you fond of viewing nature?
You don't like nature. All you like is books.
What signify a donkey's cars and bottle,
However natural? Give you your books!
Well then, right here is where I show you books.
Come straight down off this mountain just as fast
As we can fall and keep a-bouncing on our feet.
It's hell for knees unless done hell-for-leather.'

Be ready, I thought, for almost anything.

We struck a road I didn't recognize,
But welcomed for the chance to lave my shoes
In dust once more. We followed this a mile,
Perhaps, to where it ended at a house
I didn't know was there. It was the kind
To bring me to for broad-board paneling.
I never saw so good a house deserted.

'Excuse me if I ask you in a window
That happens to be broken, Davis said.
'The outside doors as yet have held against us.
I want to introduce you to the people
Who used to live here. They were Robinsons.
You must have heard of Clara Robinson,
The poetess who wrote the book of verses
And had it published. It was all about
The posies on her inner windowsill,
And the birds on her outer windowsill,
And how she tended both, or had them tended:
She never tended anything herself.
She was 'shut in' for life. She lived her whole
Life long in bed, and wrote her things in bed.
I'll show You how she had her sills extended
To entertain the birds and hold the flowers.
Our business first's up attic with her books.'

We trod uncomfortably on crunching glass
Through a house stripped of everything
Except, it seemed, the poetess's poems.
Books, I should say!- if books are what is needed.
A whole edition in a packing case
That, overflowing like a horn of plenty,
Or like the poetess's heart of love,
Had spilled them near the window, toward the light
Where driven rain had wet and swollen them.
Enough to stock a village library-
Unfortunately all of one kind, though.
They bad been brought home from some publisher
And taken thus into the family.
Boys and bad hunters had known what to do
With stone and lead to unprotected glass:
Shatter it inward on the unswept floors.
How had the tender verse escaped their outrage?
By being invisible for what it was,
Or else by some remoteness that defied them
To find out what to do to hurt a poem.
Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,
To send it sailing out the attic window
Till it caught wind and, opening out its covers,
Tried to improve on sailing like a tile
By flying like a bird (silent in flight,
But all the burden of its body song),
Only to tumble like a stricken bird,
And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.
Books were not thrown irreverently about.
They simply lay where someone now and then,
Having tried one, had dropped it at his feet
And left it lying where it fell rejected.
Here were all those the poetess's life
Had been too short to sell or give away.

'Take one,' Old Davis bade me graciously.

'Why not take two or three?'

'Take all you want.'
Good-looking books like that.' He picked one fresh
In virgin wrapper from deep in the box,
And stroked it with a horny-handed kindness.
He read in one and I read in another,
Both either looking for or finding something.

The attic wasps went missing by like bullets.

I was soon satisfied for the time being.

All the way home I kept remembering
The small book in my pocket. It was there.
The poetess had sighed, I knew, in heaven
At having eased her heart of one more copy-
Legitimately. My demand upon her,
Though slight, was a demand. She felt the tug.
In time she would be rid of all her books.

A neighbor of mine in the village
Likes to tell how one spring
When she was a girl on the farm, she did
A childlike thing.

One day she asked her father
To give her a garden plot
To plant and tend and reap herself,
And he said, 'Why not?'

In casting about for a corner
He thought of an idle bit
Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood,
And he said, 'Just it.'

And he said, 'That ought to make you
An ideal one-girl farm,
And give you a chance to put some strength
On your slim-jim arm.'

It was not enough of a garden
Her father said, to plow;
So she had to work it all by hand,
But she don't mind now.

She wheeled the dung in a wheelbarrow
Along a stretch of road;
But she always ran away and left
Her not-nice load,

And hid from anyone passing.
And then she begged the seed.
She says she thinks she planted one
Of all things but weed.

A hill each of potatoes,
Radishes, lettuce, peas,
Tomatoes, beets, beans, pumpkins, corn,
And even fruit trees.

And yes, she has long mistrusted
That a cider-apple
In bearing there today is hers,
Or at least may be.

Her crop was a miscellany
When all was said and done,
A little bit of everything,
A great deal of none.

Now when she sees in the village
How village things go,
Just when it seems to come in right,
She says, 'I know!

'It's as when I was a farmer...'
Oh never by way of advice!
And she never sins by telling the tale
To the same person twice.

To think to know the country and now know
The hillside on the day the sun lets go
Ten million silver lizards out of snow!
As often as I've seen it done before
I can't pretend to tell the way it's done.
It looks as if some magic of the sun
Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor
And the light breaking on them made them run.
But if I though to stop the wet stampede,
And caught one silver lizard by the tail,
And put my foot on one without avail,
And threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed
In front of twenty others' wriggling speed,-
In the confusion of them all aglitter,
And birds that joined in the excited fun
By doubling and redoubling song and twitter,
I have no doubt I'd end by holding none.

It takes the moon for this. The sun's a wizard
By all I tell; but so's the moon a witch.
From the high west she makes a gentle cast
And suddenly, without a jerk or twitch,
She has her speel on every single lizard.
I fancied when I looked at six o'clock
The swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast.
The moon was waiting for her chill effect.
I looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock
In every lifelike posture of the swarm,
Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect.
Across each other and side by side they lay.
The spell that so could hold them as they were
Was wrought through trees without a breath of storm
To make a leaf, if there had been one, stir.
One lizard at the end of every ray.
The thought of my attempting such a stray!

When I go up through the mowing field,
The headless aftermath,
   Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,
 Half closes the garden path.

   And when I come to the garden ground,
The whir of sober birds
 Up from the tangle of withered weeds
 Is sadder than any words

A tree beside the wall stands bare,
 But a leaf that lingered brown,
   Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,
 Comes softly rattling down.

 I end not far from my going forth
   By picking the faded blue
Of the last remaining aster flower
 To carry again to you.

The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift.
 The road is forlorn all day,
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,
 And the hoof-prints vanish away.
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
 Expend their bloom in vain.
Come over the hills and far with me,
 And be my love in the rain.

The birds have less to say for themselves
 In the wood-world's torn despair
Than now these numberless years the elves,
 Although they are no less there:
All song of the woods is crushed like some
 Wild, earily shattered rose.
Come, be my love in the wet woods, come,
 Where the boughs rain when it blows.

There is the gale to urge behind
 And bruit our singing down,
And the shallow waters aflutter with wind
 From which to gather your gown.
What matter if we go clear to the west,
 And come not through dry-shod?
For wilding brooch shall wet your breast
 The rain-fresh goldenrod.

Oh, never this whelming east wind swells
 But it seems like the sea's return
To the ancient lands where it left the shells
 Before the age of the fern;
And it seems like the time when after doubt
 Our love came back amain.
Oh, come forth into the storm and rout
 And be my love in the rain.

To Ridgely Torrence
On Last Looking into His 'Hesperides'

I often see flowers from a passing car
That are gone before I can tell what they are.

I want to get out of the train and go back
To see what they were beside the track.

I name all the flowers I am sure they weren't;
Not fireweed loving where woods have burnt-

Not bluebells gracing a tunnel mouth-
Not lupine living on sand and drouth.

Was something brushed across my mind
That no one on earth will ever find?

Heaven gives it glimpses only to those
Not in position to look too close.

There's a patch of old snow in a corner
That I should have guessed
Was a blow-away paper the rain
Had brought to rest.

It is speckled with grime as if
Small print overspread it,
The news of a day I've forgotten â€”
If I ever read it.

Dust always blowing about the town,
Except when sea-fog laid it down,
And I was one of the children told
Some of the blowing dust was gold.

All the dust the wind blew high
Appeared like god in the sunset sky,
But I was one of the children told
Some of the dust was really gold.

Such was life in the Golden Gate:
Gold dusted all we drank and ate,
And I was one of the children told,
'We all must eat our peck of gold.'

Oh, give us pleasure in the flowers today;
And give us not to think so far away
As the uncertain harvest; keep us here
All simply in the springing of the year.

Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,
Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;
And make us happy in the happy bees,
The swarm dilating round the perfect trees.

And make us happy in the darting bird
That suddenly above the bees is heard,
The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,
And off a blossom in mid air stands still.

For this is love and nothing else is love,
To which it is reserved for God above
To sanctify to what far ends he will,
But which it only needs that we fulfill.

A voice said, Look me in the stars
And tell me truly, men of earth,
If all the soul-and-body scars
Were not too much to pay for birth.

I didn't make you know how glad I was
To have you come and camp here on our land.
I promised myself to get down some day
And see the way you lived, but I don't know!
With a houseful of hungry men to feed
I guess you'd findâ€¦. It seems to me
I can't express my feelings any more
Than I can raise my voice or want to lift
My hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to).
Did ever you feel so? I hope you never.
It's got so I don't even know for sure
Whether I am glad, sorry, or anything.
There's nothing but a voice-like left inside
That seems to tell me how I ought to feel,
And would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong.
You take the lake. I look and look at it.
I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water.
I stand and make myself repeat out loud
The advantages it has, so long and narrow,
Like a deep piece of some old running river
Cut short off at both ends. It lies five miles
Straight away through the mountain notch
From the sink window where I wash the plates,
And all our storms come up toward the house,
Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter.
It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
To step outdoors and take the water dazzle
A sunny morning, or take the rising wind
About my face and body and through my wrapper,
When a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den,
And a cold chill shivered across the lake.
I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,
Our Willoughby! How did you hear of it?
I expect, though, everyone's heard of it.
In a book about ferns? Listen to that!
You let things more like feathers regulate
Your going and coming. And you like it here?
I can see how you might. But I don't know!
It would be different if more people came,
For then there would be business. As it is,
The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,
Sometimes we don't. We've a good piece of shore
That ought to be worth something, and may yet.
But I don't count on it as much as Len.
He looks on the bright side of everything,
Including me. He thinks I'll be all right
With doctoring. But it's not medicineâ€”
Lowe is the only doctor's dared to say soâ€”
It's rest I wantâ€”there, I have said it outâ€”
From cooking meals for hungry hired men
And washing dishes after themâ€”from doing
Things over and over that just won't stay done.
By good rights I ought not to have so much
Put on me, but there seems no other way.
Len says one steady pull more ought to do it.
He says the best way out is always through.
And I agree to that, or in so far
As that I can see no way out but throughâ€”
Leastways for meâ€”and then they'll be convinced.
It's not that Len don't want the best for me.
It was his plan our moving over in
Beside the lake from where that day I showed you
We used to liveâ€”ten miles from anywhere.
We didn't change without some sacrifice,
But Len went at it to make up the loss.
His work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,
But he works when he works as hard as I doâ€”
Though there's small profit in comparisons.
(Women and men will make them all the same.)
But work ain't all. Len undertakes too much.
He's into everything in town. This year
It's highways, and he's got too many men
Around him to look after that make waste.
They take advantage of him shamefully,
And proud, too, of themselves for doing so.
We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,
Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
While I fry their bacon. Much they care!
No more put out in what they do or say
Than if I wasn't in the room at all.
Coming and going all the time, they are:
I don't learn what their names are, let alone
Their characters, or whether they are safe
To have inside the house with doors unlocked.
I'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not
Afraid of me. There's two can play at that.
I have my fancies: it runs in the family.
My father's brother wasn't right. They kept him
Locked up for years back there at the old farm.
I've been away onceâ€”yes, I've been away.
The State Asylum. I was prejudiced;
I wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;
You know the old ideaâ€”the only asylum
Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,
Rather than send their folks to such a place,
Kept them at home; and it does seem more human.
But it's not so: the place is the asylum.
There they have every means proper to do with,
And you aren't darkening other people's livesâ€”
Worse than no good to them, and they no good
To you in your condition; you can't know
Affection or the want of it in that state.
I've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.
My father's brother, he went mad quite young.
Some thought he had been bitten by a dog,
Because his violence took on the form
Of carrying his pillow in his teeth;
But it's more likely he was crossed in love,
Or so the story goes. It was some girl.
Anyway all he talked about was love.
They soon saw he would do someone a mischief
If he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended
In father's building him a sort of cage,
Or room within a room, of hickory poles,
Like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,â€”
A narrow passage all the way around.
Anything they put in for furniture
He'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.
So they made the place comfortable with straw,
Like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences.
Of course they had to feed him without dishes.
They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded
With his clothes on his armâ€”all of his clothes.
Cruelâ€”it sounds. I 'spose they did the best
They knew. And just when he was at the height,
Father and mother married, and mother came,
A bride, to help take care of such a creature,
And accommodate her young life to his.
That was what marrying father meant to her.
She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
By his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout
Until the strength was shouted out of him,
And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.
He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,
And let them go and make them twang until
His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.
And then he'd crow as if he thought that child's playâ€”
The only fun he had. I've heard them say, though,
They found a way to put a stop to it.
He was before my timeâ€”I never saw him;
But the pen stayed exactly as it was
There in the upper chamber in the ell,
A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.
I often think of the smooth hickory bars.
It got so I would sayâ€”you know, half foolingâ€”
"It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail"â€”
Just as you will till it becomes a habit.
No wonder I was glad to get away.
Mind you, I waited till Len said the word.
I didn't want the blame if things went wrong.
I was glad though, no end, when we moved out,
And I looked to be happy, and I was,
As I said, for a whileâ€”but I don't know!
Somehow the change wore out like a prescription.
And there's more to it than just window-views
And living by a lake. I'm past such helpâ€”
Unless Len took the notion, which he won't,
And I won't ask himâ€”it's not sure enough.
I 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going:
Other folks have to, and why shouldn't I?
I almost think if I could do like you,
Drop everything and live out on the groundâ€”
But it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it,
Or a long rain. I should soon get enough,
And be glad of a good roof overhead.
I've lain awake thinking of you, I'll warrant,
More than you have yourself, some of these nights.
The wonder was the tents weren't snatched away
From over you as you lay in your beds.
I haven't courage for a risk like that.
Bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,
But the thing of it is, I need to be kept.
There's work enough to doâ€”there's always that;
But behind's behind. The worst that you can do
Is set me back a little more behind.
I sha'n't catch up in this world, anyway.
I'd rather you'd not go unless you must.

He is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,
That lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,
But still lies pointed as it plowed the dust.
If we who sight along it round the world,
See nothing worthy to have been its mark,
It is because like men we look too near,
Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,
Our missiles always make too short an arc.
They fall, they rip the grass, they intersect
The curve of earth, and striking, break their own;
They make us cringe for metal-point on stone.
But this we know, the obstacle that checked
And tripped the body, shot the spirit on
Further than target ever showed or shone.


Never tell me that not one star of all
That slip from heaven at night and softly fall
Has been picked up with stones to build a wall.

Some laborer found one faded and stone-cold,
And saving that its weight suggested gold
And tugged it from his first too certain hold,

He noticed nothing in it to remark.
He was not used to handling stars thrown dark
And lifeless from an interrupted arc.

He did not recognize in that smooth coal
The one thing palpable besides the soul
To penetrate the air in which we roll.

He did not see how like a flying thing
It brooded ant eggs, and bad one large wing,
One not so large for flying in a ring,

And a long Bird of Paradise's tail
(Though these when not in use to fly and trail
It drew back in its body like a snail):

Nor know that be might move it from the spotâ€”
The harm was done: from having been star-shot
The very nature of the soil was hot

And burning to yield flowers instead of grain,
Flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain
Poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain.

He moved it roughly with an iron bar,
He loaded an old stoneboat with the star
And not, as you might think, a flying car,

Such as even poets would admit perforce
More practical than Pegasus the horse
If it could put a star back in its course.

He dragged it through the plowed ground at a pace
But faintly reminiscent of the race
Of jostling rock in interstellar space.

It went for building stone, and I, as though
Commanded in a dream, forever go
To right the wrong that this should have been so.

Yet ask where else it could have gone as well,
I do not knowâ€”I cannot stop to tell:
He might have left it lying where it fell.

From following walls I never lift my eye,
Except at night to places in the sky
Where showers of charted meteors let fly.

Some may know what they seek in school and church,
And why they seek it there; for what I search
I must go measuring stone walls, perch on perch;

Sure that though not a star of death and birth,
So not to be compared, perhaps, in worth
To such resorts of life as Mars and Earthâ€”

Though not, I say, a star of death and sin,
It yet has poles, and only needs a spin
To show its worldly nature and begin

To chafe and shuffle in my calloused palm
And run off in strange tangents with my arm,
As fish do with the line in first alarm.

Such as it is, it promises the prize
Of the one world complete in any size
That I am like to compass, fool or wise.

When a friend calls to me from the road
And slows his horse to a meaning walk,
I don't stand still and look around
On all the hills I haven't hoed,
And shout from where I am, What is it?
No, not as there is a time to talk.
I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,
Blade-end up and five feet tall,
And plod: I go up to the stone wall
For a friendly visit.

A winter garden in an alder swamp,
Where conies now come out to sun and romp,
As near a paradise as it can be
And not melt snow or start a dormant tree.

It lifts existence on a plane of snow
One level higher than the earth below,
One level nearer heaven overhead,
And last year's berries shining scarlet red.

It lifts a gaunt luxuriating beast
Where he can stretch and hold his highest feat
On some wild apple tree's young tender bark,
What well may prove the year's high girdle mark.

So near to paradise all pairing ends:
Here loveless birds now flock as winter friends,
Content with bud-inspecting. They presume
To say which buds are leaf and which are bloom.

A feather-hammer gives a double knock.
This Eden day is done at two o'clock.
An hour of winter day might seem too short
To make it worth life's while to wake and sport.

When the spent sun throws up its rays on cloud
And goes down burning into the gulf below,
No voice in nature is heard to cry aloud
At what has happened. Birds, at least must know
It is the change to darkness in the sky.
Murmuring something quiet in her breast,
One bird begins to close a faded eye;
Or overtaken too far from his nest,
Hurrying low above the grove, some waif
Swoops just in time to his remembered tree.
At most he thinks or twitters softly, 'Safe!
Now let the night be dark for all of me.
Let the night be too dark for me to see
Into the future. Let what will be, be.'

When I see birches bend to left and right
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
After a rain. They click upon themselves
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crustâ€”
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed
So low for long, they never right themselves:
You may see their trunks arching in the woods
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
But I was going to say when Truth broke in
With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm
(Now am I free to be poetical?)
I should prefer to have some boy bend them
As he went out and in to fetch the cowsâ€”
Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,
Whose only play was what he found himself,
Summer or winter, and could play alone.
One by one he subdued his father's trees
By riding them down over and over again
Until he took the stiffness out of them,
And not one but hung limp, not one was left
For him to conquer. He learned all there was
To learn about not launching out too soon
And so not carrying the tree away
Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise
To the top branches, climbing carefully
With the same pains you use to fill a cup
Up to the brim, and even above the brim.
Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,
Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.
So was I once myself a swinger of birches.
And so I dream of going back to be.
It's when I'm weary of considerations,
And life is too much like a pathless wood
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping
From a twig's having lashed across it open.
I'd like to get away from earth awhile
And then come back to it and begin over.
May no fate willfully misunderstand me
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:
I don't know where it's likely to go better.
I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,
And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,
But dipped its top and set me down again.
That would be good both going and coming back.
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.

I have been one acquainted with the night.
I have walked out in rain â€” and back in rain.
I have outwalked the furthest city light.

I have looked down the saddest city lane.
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street,

But not to call me back or say good-bye;
And further still at an unearthly height,
A luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
I have been one acquainted with the night.

ONCE on the kind of day called "weather breeder,"
When the heat slowly hazes and the sun
By its own power seems to be undone,
I was half boring through, half climbing through
A swamp of cedar. Choked with oil of cedar
And scurf of plants, and weary and over-heated,
And sorry I ever left the road I knew,
I paused and rested on a sort of hook
That had me by the coat as good as seated,
And since there was no other way to look,
Looked up toward heaven, and there against the blue,
Stood over me a resurrected tree,
A tree that had been down and raised againâ€”
A barkless spectre. He had halted too,
As if for fear of treading upon me.
I saw the strange position of his handsâ€”
Up at his shoulders, dragging yellow strands
Of wire with something in it from men to men.
"You here?" I said. "Where aren't you nowadays
And what's the news you carryâ€”if you know?
And tell me where you're off forâ€”Montreal?
Me? I'm not off for anywhere at all.
Sometimes I wander out of beaten ways
Half looking for the orchid Calypso."

The city had withdrawn into itself
And left at last the country to the country;
When between whirls of snow not come to lie
And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove
A stranger to our yard, who looked the city,
Yet did in country fashion in that there
He sat and waited till he drew us out
A-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.
He proved to be the city come again
To look for something it had left behind
And could not do without and keep its Christmas.
He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;
My woods ”the young fir balsams like a place
Where houses all are churches and have spires.
I hadnâ€TMt thought of them as Christmas Trees.
I doubt if I was tempted for a moment
To sell them off their feet to go in cars
And leave the slope behind the house all bare,
Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.
Iâ€TMd hate to have them know it if I was.
Yet more Iâ€TMd hate to hold my trees except
As others hold theirs or refuse for them,
Beyond the time of profitable growth,
The trial by market everything must come to.
I dallied so much with the thought of selling.
Then whether from mistaken courtesy
And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether
From hope of hearing good of what was mine,
I said, â€œThere arenâ€TMt enough to be worth while.â€
â€œI could soon tell how many they would cut,
You let me look them over.â€

â€œYou could look.
But donâ€TMt expect Iâ€TMm going to let you have them.â€
Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close
That lop each other of boughs, but not a few
Quite solitary and having equal boughs
All round and round. The latter he nodded â€œYesâ€ to,
Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one,
With a buyerâ€TMs moderation, â€œThat would do.â€
I thought so too, but wasnâ€TMt there to say so.
We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,
And came down on the north.
He said, â€œA thousand.â€

â€œA thousand Christmas trees!â€”at what apiece?â€

He felt some need of softening that to me:
â€œA thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.â€

Then I was certain I had never meant
To let him have them. Never show surprise!
But thirty dollars seemed so small beside
The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents
(For that was all they figured out apiece),
Three cents so small beside the dollar friends
I should be writing to within the hour
Would pay in cities for good trees like those,
Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools
Could hang enough on to pick off enough.
A thousand Christmas trees I didnâ€TMt know I had!
Worth three cents more to give away than sell,
As may be shown by a simple calculation.
Too bad I couldnâ€TMt lay one in a letter.
I canâ€TMt help wishing I could send you one,
In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.


Blueberries as big as the end of your thumb,
Real sky-blue, and heavy, and ready to drum
In the cavernous pail of the first one to come!
And all ripe together, not some of them green
And some of them ripe! You ought to have seen!

It is a blue-butterfly day here in spring,
And with these sky-flakes down in flurry on flurry
There is more unmixed color on the wing
Than flowers will show for days unless they hurry.

But these are flowers that fly and all but sing:
And now from having ridden out desire
They lie closed over in the wind and cling
Where wheels have freshly sliced the April mire.


I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed- and gazed- but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

I marvel how Nature could ever find space
For so many strange contrasts in one human face:
There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom
And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom.

There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain;
Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain
Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease,
Would be rational peace--a philosopher's ease.

There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds,
And attention full ten times as much as there needs;
Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy;
And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy.

There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare
Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there,
There's virtue, the title it surely may claim,
Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name.

This picture from nature may seem to depart,
Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart;
And I for five centuries right gladly would be
Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he.

Lo! where the Moon along the sky
Sails with her happy destiny;
Oft is she hid from mortal eye
Or dimly seen,
But when the clouds asunder fly
How bright her mien!

Far different we--a froward race,
Thousands though rich in Fortune's grace
With cherished sullenness of pace
Their way pursue,
Ingrates who wear a smileless face
The whole year through.

If kindred humours e'er would make
My spirit droop for drooping's sake,
From Fancy following in thy wake,
Bright ship of heaven!
A counter impulse let me take
And be forgiven.

The world is too much with us; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
Little we see in Nature that is ours;
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
The winds that will be howling at all hours,
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;
For this, for everything, we are out of tune,
It moves us not.--Great God! I'd rather be
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.

She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove,
Maid whom there were none to praise
And very few to love:

A violet by a mossy stone
Half hidden from the eye!
---Fair as a star, when only one
Is shining in the sky.

She lived unknown, and few could know
When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave, and, oh,
The difference to me!

Calm is all nature as a resting wheel.
The kine are couched upon the dewy grass;
The horse alone, seen dimly as I pass,
Is cropping audibly his later meal:
Dark is the ground; a slumber seems to steal
O'er vale, and mountain, and the starless sky.
Now, in this blank of things, a harmony,
Home-felt, and home-created, comes to heal
That grief for which the senses still supply
Fresh food; for only then, when memory
Is hushed, am I at rest. My Friends! restrain
Those busy cares that would allay my pain;
Oh! leave me to myself, nor let me feel
The officious touch that makes me droop again.

Behold her, single in the field,
Yon solitary Highland Lass!
Reaping and singing by herself;
Stop here, or gently pass!
Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
And sings a melancholy strain;
O listen! for the Vale profound
Is overflowing with the sound.

No Nightingale did ever chaunt
More welcome notes to weary bands
Of travellers in some shady haunt,
Among Arabian sands:
A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,
Breaking the silence of the seas
Among the farthest Hebrides.

Will no one tell me what she sings?--
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
For old, unhappy, far-off things,
And battles long ago:
Or is it some more humble lay,
Familiar matter of to-day?
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,
That has been, and may be again?

Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang
As if her song could have no ending;
I saw her singing at her work,
And o'er the sickle bending;--
I listened, motionless and still;
And, as I mounted up the hill,
The music in my heart I bore,
Long after it was heard no more.

There is a change- and I am poor;
Your love hath been, nor long ago,
A fountain at my fond heart's door,
Whose only business was to flow;
And flow it did; not taking heed
Of its own bounty, or my need.

What happy moments did I count!
Blest was I then all bliss above!
Now, for that consecrated fount
Of murmuring, sparkling, living love,
What have I? Shall I dare to tell?
A comfortless and hidden well.

A well of love- it may be deep-
I trust it is,- and never dry:
What matter? If the waters sleep
In silence and obscurity.
- Such change, and at the very door
Of my fond heart, hath made me poor.

------The sky is overcast
With a continuous cloud of texture close,
Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon,
Which through that veil is indistinctly seen,
A dull, contracted circle, yielding light
So feebly spread, that not a shadow falls,
Chequering the ground--from rock, plant, tree, or tower.
At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam
Startles the pensive traveller while he treads
His lonesome path, with unobserving eye
Bent earthwards; he looks up--the clouds are split
Asunder,--and above his head he sees
The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens.
There, in a black-blue vault she sails along,
Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small
And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss
Drive as she drives: how fast they wheel away,
Yet vanish not!--the wind is in the tree,
But they are silent;--still they roll along
Immeasurably distant; and the vault,
Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds,
Still deepens its unfathomable depth.
At length the Vision closes; and the mind,
Not undisturbed by the delight it feels,
Which slowly settles into peaceful calm,
Is left to muse upon the solemn scene.

It was an April morning: fresh and clear
The Rivulet, delighting in its strength,
Ran with a young man's speed; and yet the voice
Of waters which the winter had supplied
Was softened down into a vernal tone.
The spirit of enjoyment and desire,
And hopes and wishes, from all living things
Went circling, like a multitude of sounds.
The budding groves seemed eager to urge on
The steps of June; as if their various hues
Were only hindrances that stood between
Them and their object: but, meanwhile, prevailed
Such an entire contentment in the air
That every naked ash, and tardy tree
Yet leafless, showed as if the countenance
With which it looked on this delightful day
Were native to the summer.--Up the brook
I roamed in the confusion of my heart,
Alive to all things and forgetting all.
At length I to a sudden turning came
In this continuous glen, where down a rock
The Stream, so ardent in its course before,
Sent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all
Which I till then had heard, appeared the voice
Of common pleasure: beast and bird, the lamb,
The shepherd's dog, the linnet and the thrush
Vied with this waterfall, and made a song,
Which, while I listened, seemed like the wild growth
Or like some natural produce of the air,
That could not cease to be. Green leaves were here;
But 'twas the foliage of the rocks--the birch,
The yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn,
With hanging islands of resplendent furze:
And, on a summit, distant a short space,
By any who should look beyond the dell,
A single mountain-cottage might be seen.
I gazed and gazed, and to myself I said,
'Our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook,
My EMMA, I will dedicate to thee.'
----Soon did the spot become my other home,
My dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode.
And, of the Shepherds who have seen me there,
To whom I sometimes in our idle talk
Have told this fancy, two or three, perhaps,
Years after we are gone and in our graves,
When they have cause to speak of this wild place,
May call it by the name of EMMA'S DELL.

A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags,
A rude and natural causeway, interposed
Between the water and a winding slope
Of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore
Of Grasmere safe in its own privacy:
And there myself and two beloved Friends,
One calm September morning, ere the mist
Had altogether yielded to the sun,
Sauntered on this retired and difficult way.
----Ill suits the road with one in haste; but we
Played with our time; and, as we strolled along,
It was our occupation to observe
Such objects as the waves had tossed ashore--
Feather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough,
Each on the other heaped, along the line
Of the dry wreck. And, in our vacant mood,
Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft
Of dandelion seed or thistle's beard,
That skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake,
Suddenly halting now--a lifeless stand!
And starting off again with freak as sudden;
In all its sportive wanderings, all the while,
Making report of an invisible breeze
That was its wings, its chariot, and its horse,
Its playmate, rather say, its moving soul.
--And often, trifling with a privilege
Alike indulged to all, we paused, one now,
And now the other, to point out, perchance
To pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair
Either to be divided from the place
On which it grew, or to be left alone
To its own beauty. Many such there are,
Fair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern,
So stately, of the queen Osmunda named;
Plant lovelier, in its own retired abode
On Grasmere's beach, than Naiad by the side
Of Grecian brook, or Lady of the Mere,
Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance.
--So fared we that bright morning: from the fields
Meanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth
Of reapers, men and women, boys and girls.
Delighted much to listen to those sounds,
And feeding thus our fancies, we advanced
Along the indented shore; when suddenly,
Through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen
Before us, on a point of jutting land,
The tall and upright figure of a Man
Attired in peasant's garb, who stood alone,
Angling beside the margin of the lake.
'Improvident and reckless,' we exclaimed,
'The Man must be, who thus can lose a day
Of the mid harvest, when the labourer's hire
Is ample, and some little might be stored
Wherewith to cheer him in the winter time.'
Thus talking of that Peasant, we approached
Close to the spot where with his rod and line
He stood alone; whereat he turned his head
To greet us--and we saw a Mam worn down
By sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks
And wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean
That for my single self I looked at them,
Forgetful of the body they sustained.--
Too weak to labour in the harvest field,
The Man was using his best skill to gain
A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake
That knew not of his wants. I will not say
What thoughts immediately were ours, nor how
The happy idleness of that sweet morn,
With all its lovely images, was changed
To serious musing and to self-reproach.
Nor did we fail to see within ourselves
What need there is to be reserved in speech,
And temper all our thoughts with charity.
--Therefore, unwilling to forget that day,
My Friend, Myself, and She who then received
The same admonishment, have called the place
By a memorial name, uncouth indeed
As e'er by mariner was given to bay
Or foreland, on a new-discovered coast;
And POINT RASH-JUDGMENT is the name it bears.

Five years have past; five summers, with the length
Of five long winters! and again I hear
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs
With a soft inland murmur.--Once again
Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,
That on a wild secluded scene impress
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.
The day is come when I again repose
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,
Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,
Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves
'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!
With some uncertain notice, as might seem
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,
Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire
The Hermit sits alone.
These beauteous forms,
Through a long absence, have not been to me
As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:
But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;
And passing even into my purer mind,
With tranquil restoration:--feelings too
Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,
As have no slight or trivial influence
On that best portion of a good man's life,
His little, nameless, unremembered, acts
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,
To them I may have owed another gift,
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,
In which the burthen of the mystery,
In which the heavy and the weary weight
Of all this unintelligible world,
Is lightened:--that serene and blessed mood,
In which the affections gently lead us on,--
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame
And even the motion of our human blood
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep
In body, and become a living soul:
While with an eye made quiet by the power
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
We see into the life of things.
If this
Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft--
In darkness and amid the many shapes
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart--
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,
O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,
How often has my spirit turned to thee!
And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,
With many recognitions dim and faint,
And somewhat of a sad perplexity,
The picture of the mind revives again:
While here I stand, not only with the sense
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts
That in this moment there is life and food
For future years. And so I dare to hope,
Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first
I came among these hills; when like a roe
I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides
Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,
Wherever nature led: more like a man
Flying from something that he dreads, than one
Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,
And their glad animal movements all gone by)
To me was all in all.--I cannot paint
What then I was. The sounding cataract
Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
Their colours and their forms, were then to me
An appetite; a feeling and a love,
That had no need of a remoter charm,
By thought supplied, nor any interest
Unborrowed from the eye.--That time is past,
And all its aching joys are now no more,
And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this
Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts
Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,
Abundant recompence. For I have learned
To look on nature, not as in the hour
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes
The still, sad music of humanity,
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power
To chasten and subdue. And I have felt
A presence that disturbs me with the joy
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime
Of something far more deeply interfused,
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
And the round ocean and the living air,
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man;
A motion and a spirit, that impels 0
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still
A lover of the meadows and the woods,
And mountains; and of all that we behold
From this green earth; of all the mighty world
Of eye, and ear,--both what they half create,
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise
In nature and the language of the sense,
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul
Of all my moral being.
Nor perchance,
If I were not thus taught, should I the more
Suffer my genial spirits to decay:
For thou art with me here upon the banks
Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,
My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch
The language of my former heart, and read
My former pleasures in the shooting lights
Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while
May I behold in thee what I was once,
My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,
Knowing that Nature never did betray
The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,
Through all the years of this our life, to lead
From joy to joy: for she can so inform
The mind that is within us, so impress
With quietness and beauty, and so feed
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,
Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all
The dreary intercourse of daily life,
Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb
Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold
Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon
Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;
And let the misty mountain-winds be free
To blow against thee: and, in after years,
When these wild ecstasies shall be matured
Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind
Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,
Thy memory be as a dwelling-place
For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,
Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts
Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,
And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance--
If I should be where I no more can hear
Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams
Of past existence--wilt thou then forget
That on the banks of this delightful stream
We stood together; and that I, so long
A worshipper of Nature, hither came
Unwearied in that service: rather say
With warmer love--oh! with far deeper zeal
Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,
That after many wanderings, many years
Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,
And this green pastoral landscape, were to me
More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!

A Whirl-Blast from behind the hill
Rushed o'er the wood with startling sound;
Then--all at once the air was still,
And showers of hailstones pattered round.
Where leafless oaks towered high above,
I sat within an undergrove
Of tallest hollies, tall and green;
A fairer bower was never seen.
From year to year the spacious floor
With withered leaves is covered o'er,
And all the year the bower is green.
But see! where'er the hailstones drop
The withered leaves all skip and hop;
There's not a breeze--no breath of air--
Yet here, and there, and everywhere
Along the floor, beneath the shade
By those embowering hollies made,
The leaves in myriads jump and spring,
As if with pipes and music rare
Some Robin Good-fellow were there,
And all those leaves, in festive glee,
Were dancing to the minstrelsy.

Strange fits of passion have I known:
And I will dare to tell,
But in the lover's ear alone,
What once to me befell.

When she I loved looked every day
Fresh as a rose in June,
I to her cottage bent my way,
Beneath an evening-moon.

Upon the moon I fixed my eye,
All over the wide lea;
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
Those paths so dear to me.

And now we reached the orchard-plot;
And, as we climbed the hill,
The sinking moon to Lucy's cot
Came near, and nearer still.

In one of those sweet dreams I slept,
Kind Nature's gentlest boon!
And all the while my eye I kept
On the descending moon.

My horse moved on; hoof after hoof
He raised, and never stopped:
When down behind the cottage roof,
At once, the bright moon dropped.

What fond and wayward thoughts will slide
Into a Lover's head!
'O mercy!' to myself I cried,
'If Lucy hould be dead!'

A slumber did my spirit seal
I had no human fears:
She seemed a thing that could not feel
The touch of earthly years.

No motion has she now, no force;
She neither hears nor sees;
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course,
With rocks, and stones, and trees.

Earth has not anything to show more fair:
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
A sight so touching in its majesty:
This City now doth, like a garment, wear
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
Never did sun more beautifully steep
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
The river glideth at his own sweet will:
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
And all that mighty heart is lying still!

My heart leaps up when I behold
A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began;
So is it now I am a man;
So be it when I shall grow old,
Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.

FAREWELL, thou little Nook of mountain-ground,
Thou rocky corner in the lowest stair
Of that magnificent temple which doth bound
One side of our whole vale with grandeur rare;
Sweet garden-orchard, eminently fair,
The loveliest spot that man hath ever found,
Farewell!--we leave thee to Heaven's peaceful care,
Thee, and the Cottage which thou dost surround.

Our boat is safely anchored by the shore,
And there will safely ride when we are gone;
The flowering shrubs that deck our humble door
Will prosper, though untended and alone:
Fields, goods, and far-off chattels we have none:
These narrow bounds contain our private store
Of things earth makes, and sun doth shine upon;
Here are they in our sight--we have no more.

Sunshine and shower be with you, bud and bell!
For two months now in vain we shall be sought:
We leave you here in solitude to dwell
With these our latest gifts of tender thought;
Thou, like the morning, in thy saffron coat,
Bright gowan, and marsh-marigold, farewell!
Whom from the borders of the Lake we brought,
And placed together near our rocky Well.

We go for One to whom ye will be dear;
And she will prize this Bower, this Indian shed,
Our own contrivance, Building without peer!
--A gentle Maid, whose heart is lowly bred,
Whose pleasures are in wild fields gathered,
With joyousness, and with a thoughtful cheer,
Will come to you; to you herself will wed;
And love the blessed life that we lead here.

Dear Spot! which we have watched with tender heed,
Bringing thee chosen plants and blossoms blown
Among the distant mountains, flower and weed,
Which thou hast taken to thee as thy own,
Making all kindness registered and known;
Thou for our sakes, though Nature's child indeed,
Fair in thyself and beautiful alone,
Hast taken gifts which thou dost little need.

And O most constant, yet most fickle Place,
Thou hast thy wayward moods, as thou dost show
To them who look not daily on thy face;
Who, being loved, in love no bounds dost know,
And say'st, when we forsake thee, 'Let them go!'
Thou easy-hearted Thing, with thy wild race
Of weeds and flowers, till we return be slow,
And travel with the year at a soft pace.

Help us to tell Her tales of years gone by,
And this sweet spring, the best beloved and best;
Joy will be flown in its mortality;
Something must stay to tell us of the rest.
Here, thronged with primroses, the steep rock's breast
Glittered at evening like a starry sky;
And in this bush our sparrow built her nest,
Of which I sang one song that will not die.

O happy Garden! whose seclusion deep
Hath been so friendly to industrious hours;
And to soft slumbers, that did gently steep
Our spirits, carrying with them dreams of flowers,
And wild notes warbled among leafy bowers;
Two burning months let summer overleap,
And, coming back with Her who will be ours,
Into thy bosom we again shall creep.

The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.


There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight,
To me did seem
Apparelled in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hath been of yore; -
Turn wheresoe'er I may,
By night or day,
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.


The Rainbow comes and goes,
And lovely is the Rose,
The Moon doth with delight
Look round her when the heavens are bare;
Waters on a starry night
Are beautiful and fair;
The sunshine is a glorious birth;
But yet I know, where'er I go,
That there hath past away a glory from the earth.


Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
And while the young lambs bound
As to the tabor's sound,
To me alone there came a thought of grief:
A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
And I again am strong:
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,
The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
And all the earth is gay;
Land and sea
Give themselves up to jollity,
And with the heart of May
Doth every Beast keep holiday; -
Thou Child of Joy,
Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!


Ye blesse`d Creatures, I have heard the call
Ye to each other make; I see
The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
My heart is at your festival,
My head hath its coronal,
The fulness of your bliss, I feel- I feel it all.
Oh evil day! if I were sullen
While the Earth herself is adorning,
This sweet May-morning,
And the Children are culling
On every side,
In a thousand valleys far and wide,
Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,
And the Babe leaps up on his Mother's arm:-
I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!
- But there's a Tree, of many, one,
A single Field which I have looked upon,
Both of them speak of something that is gone:
The Pansy at my feet
Doth the same tale repeat:
Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
Where is it now, the glory and the dream?



Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,
Hath had elsewhere its setting,
And cometh from afar:
Not in entire forgetfulness,
And not in utter nakedness,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come
From God, who is our home:
Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
Shades of the prison-house begin to close
Upon the growing Boy,
But He beholds the light, and whence it flows,
He sees it in his joy;
The Youth, who daily farther from the east
Must travel, still is Nature's Priest,
And by the vision splendid
Is on his way attended;
At length the Man perceives it die away,
And fade into the light of common day.



Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
And, even with something of a Mother's mind,
And no unworthy aim,
The homely Nurse doth all she can
To make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man,
Forget the glories he hath known,
And that imperial palace whence he came.


Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,
A six years' Darling of a pigmy size!
See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies,
Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses,
With light upon him from his father's eyes!
See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,
Some fragment from his dream of human life,
Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;
A wedding or a festival,
A mourning or a funeral;
And this hath now his heart,
And unto this he frames his song:
Then will he fit his tongue
To dialogues of business, love, or strife;
But it will not be long
Ere this be thrown aside,
And with new joy and pride
The little Actor cons another part;
Filling from time to time his 'humorous stage'
With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,
That Life brings with her in her equipage;
As if his whole vocation
Were endless imitation.


Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie
Thy Soul's immensity;
Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep
Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind,
That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep,
Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,-
Might Prophet! Seer blest!
On whom those truths do rest,
Which we are toiling all our lives to find,
In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;
Thou, over whom thy Immortality
Broods like the Day, a Master o'er a Slave,
A Presence which is not to be put by;
[To whom the grave
Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight
Of day or the warm light,
A place of thought where we in waiting lie; ]
Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might
Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height,
Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
The years to bring the inevitable yoke,
Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight,
And custom lie upon thee with a weight,
Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!



O joy! that in our embers
Is something that doth live,
That nature yet remembers
What was so fugitive!
The thought of our past years in me doth breed
Perpetual benediction: not indeed
For that which is most worthy to be blest;
Delight and liberty, the simple creed
Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest,
With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:-
Not for these I raise
The song of thanks and praise;
But for those obstinate questionings
Of sense and outward things,
Fallings from us, vanishings;
Blank misgivings of a Creature
Moving about in worlds not realised,
High instincts before which our mortal Nature
Did tremble like a guilty Thing surprised:
But for those first affections,
Those shadowy recollections,
Which, be they what they may,
Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,
Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make
Our noisy years seem moments in the being
Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,
To perish never;
Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavor,
Nor Man nor Boy,
Nor all that is at enmity with joy,
Can utterly abolish or destroy!
Hence in a season of calm weather
Though inland far we be,
Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea
Which brought us hither,
Can in a moment travel thither,
And see the Children sport upon the shore,
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.




Then sing, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous song!
And yet the young Lambs bound
As to the tabor's sound!
We in thought will join your throng,
Ye that pipe and ye that play,
Ye that through your hearts to-day
Feel the gladness of the May!
What though the radiance which was once so bright
Be now for ever taken from my sight,
Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;
We will grieve not, rather find
Strength in what remains behind;
In the primal sympathy
Which having been must ever be;
In the soothing thoughts that spring
Out of human suffering;
In the faith that looks through death,
In years that bring the philosophic mind.



And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,
Forebode not any severing of our loves!
Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;
I only have relinquished one delight
To live beneath your more habitual sway.
I love the Brooks which down their channels fret,
Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;
The innocent brightness of a new-born Day
Is lovely yet;
The Clouds that gather round the setting sun
Do take a sober colouring from an eye
That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality;
Another race hath been, and other palms are won.
Thanks to the human heart by which we live,
Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,
To me the meanest flower that blows can give
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.

Art thou a Statist in the van
Of public conflicts trained and bred?
- First learn to love one living man;
'Then' may'st thou think upon the dead.

A Lawyer art thou? - draw not nigh!
Go, carry to some fitter place
The keenness of that practised eye,
The hardness of that sallow face.

Art thou a Man of purple cheer?
A rosy Man, right plump to see?
Approach; yet, Doctor, not too near,
This grave no cushion is for thee.

Or art thou one of gallant pride,
A Soldier and no man of chaff?
Welcome! - but lay thy sword aside,
And lean upon a peasant's staff.

Physician art thou? one, all eyes,
Philosopher! a fingering slave,
One that would peep and botanise
Upon his mother's grave?

Wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece,
O turn aside,- and take, I pray,
That he below may rest in peace,
Thy ever-dwindling soul, away!

A Moralist perchance appears;
Led, Heaven knows how! to this poor sod:
And he has neither eyes nor ears;
Himself his world, and his own God;

One to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling
Nor form, nor feeling, great or small;
A reasoning, self-sufficing thing,
An intellectual All-in-all!

Shut close the door; press down the latch;
Sleep in thy intellectual crust;
Nor lose ten tickings of thy watch
Near this unprofitable dust.

But who is He, with modest looks,
And clad in homely russet brown?
He murmurs near the running brooks
A music sweeter than their own.

He is retired as noontide dew,
Or fountain in a noon-day grove;
And you must love him, ere to you
He will seem worthy of your love.

The outward shows of sky and earth,
Of hill and valley, he has viewed;
And impulses of deeper birth
Have come to him in solitude.

In common things that round us lie
Some random truths he can impart,-
The harvest of a quiet eye
That broods and sleeps on his own heart.

But he is weak; both Man and Boy,
Hath been an idler in the land;
Contented if he might enjoy
The things which others understand.

Come hither in thy hour of strength;
Come, weak as is a breaking wave!
Here stretch thy body at full length;
Or build thy house upon this grave.

That lightly draws its breath,
And feels its life in every limb,
What should it know of death?

I met a little cottage Girl:
She was eight years old, she said;
Her hair was thick with many a curl
That clustered round her head.

She had a rustic, woodland air,
And she was wildly clad:
Her eyes were fair, and very fair;
--Her beauty made me glad.

"Sisters and brothers, little Maid,
How many may you be?"
"How many? Seven in all," she said
And wondering looked at me.

"And where are they? I pray you tell."
She answered, "Seven are we;
And two of us at Conway dwell,
And two are gone to sea.

"Two of us in the church-yard lie,
My sister and my brother;
And, in the church-yard cottage, I
Dwell near them with my mother."

"You say that two at Conway dwell,
And two are gone to sea,
Yet ye are seven!--I pray you tell,
Sweet Maid, how this may be."

Then did the little Maid reply,
"Seven boys and girls are we;
Two of us in the church-yard lie,
Beneath the church-yard tree."

"You run about, my little Maid,
Your limbs they are alive;
If two are in the church-yard laid,
Then ye are only five."

"Their graves are green, they may be seen,"
The little Maid replied,
"Twelve steps or more from my mother's door,
And they are side by side.

"My stockings there I often knit,
My kerchief there I hem;
And there upon the ground I sit,
And sing a song to them.

"And often after sunset, Sir,
When it is light and fair,
I take my little porringer,
And eat my supper there.

"The first that died was sister Jane;
In bed she moaning lay,
Till God released her of her pain;
And then she went away.

"So in the church-yard she was laid;
And, when the grass was dry,
Together round her grave we played,
My brother John and I.

"And when the ground was white with snow,
And I could run and slide,
My brother John was forced to go,
And he lies by her side."

"How many are you, then," said I,
"If they two are in heaven?"
Quick was the little Maid's reply,
"O Master! we are seven."

"But they are dead; those two are dead!
Their spirits are in heaven!"
'Twas throwing words away; for still
The little Maid would have her will,
And said, "Nay, we are seven!"
 Executive Summary
Project Gutenberg is the first and largest collection of eBooks made
freely available to the public. The project philosophy is that the
greatest value of computers is not their computing power, but rather
their potential for the searchable storage and retrieval of library
materials. The premise for the project is that any object - whether
text, picture, sound or 3D image - that can be entered into a computer
can be replicated indefinitely. The eBooks generated by Project
Gutenberg are stored on two main servers and can then be downloaded to
local servers around the world. This case study differs form many other
ERPANET studies in that the project is volunteer-driven. As such, there
are no financial or business incentives to preserve the eBooks. The
real incentive lies in the belief that literary works in the public
domain should be freely accessible to as many people as possible for as
long as possible. By digitising everything in 'plain vanilla ASCII' as
well as many other formats, the eBooks are readable by over 99% of
computer operating systems. By avoiding proprietary formats whenever
possible, Project Gutenberg also helps to guarantee the long-term
survival of the bit streams of the eBooks. The combination of open
formats and the proliferation of copies downloaded around the world
should ensure that the Project Gutenberg eBooks currently in existence
are still accessible far into the future.



Chapter 1: The ERPANET Project
The European Commission and Swiss Confederation funded ERPANET Project
(1) (Electronic Resource Preservation and Access Network) works to
enhance the preservation of cultural and scientific digital objects
through raising awareness, providing access to experience, sharing
policies and strategies, and improving practices. To achieve these
goals ERPANET is building an active community of members and actors,
bringing together memory organisations (museums, libraries and
archives), ICT and software industry, research institutions, government
organisations, entertainment and creative industries, and commercial
sectors. ERPANET constructs authoritative information resources on
state-of-the-art developments in digital preservation, promotes
training, and provides advice and tools.

ERPANET consists of four partners and is directed by a management
committee, namely Seamus Ross (HATII, University of Glasgow; principal
director), Niklaus B├╝tikofer (Schweizerisches Bundesarchiv), Hans
Hofman (Nationaal Archief/National Archives of the Netherlands), and
Maria Guercio (ISTBAL, University of Urbino). At each of these nodes a
content editor supports their work, and Peter McKinney serves as a
co-ordinator to the project. An Advisory Committee with experts from
various organisations, institutions, and companies from all over Europe
gives advice and support to ERPANET.



Chapter 2: Scope of the Case Studies
While theoretical discussions on best practice call for urgent action
to ensure the survival of digital information, it is organisations and
institutions that are leading the drive to establish effective digital
preservation strategies (2). In order to understand the processes these
organisations are undertaking, ERPANET is conducting a series of case
studies in the area of digital preservation. In total, sixty case
studies, each of varying size, will investigate awareness, strategies,
and technologies used in an array of organisations. It is anticipated
that upwards of 500 organisations, institutions and public bodies will
eventually contribute to this research. The resulting corpus should
make a substantial contribution to our knowledge of practice in digital
preservation, and form the foundation for theory building and the
development of methodological tools. The value of these case studies
will come not only from the breadth of sectors included, but also
through the depth at which they will explore the issues.

ERPANET is deliberately and systematically approaching disparate
sectors from industry and business to facilitate discussion in areas
that have traditionally been unconnected. With these case studies
ERPANET will broaden the scope and understanding of digital
preservation through research and discussion. The case studies will be
published to improve the approaches and solutions being developed and
to reduce the redundancy of effort. The interviews are identifying
current practice not only in-depth within specific sectors, but also
cross-sectorally: what can the publishing sector learn from the
aeronautical sector? Eventually we aim to use this comparative data to
produce intra-sectoral overviews.
This cross-sectoral fertilisation is a main focus of ERPANET as laid
out in its Digital Preservation Charter (3). It is of primary
importance that disparate groups are given a mechanism through which to
come together as best practices for digital preservation are
established in each sector.

Aims
The principal aims of the study are to:
* build a picture of methods and match against context to produce best
practices;
* accumulate and make accessible information about practices;
* identify issues for further research;
* enable cross-sectoral practice comparisons;
* enable the development of assessment tools;
* create material for training seminars and workshops; and,
* develop contacts.

Potential sectors have been selected to represent a wide scope of
information production and digital preservation activity. Each sector
may present a unique perspective on digital preservation.
Organisational and sectoral requirements, awareness of digital
preservation, resources available, and the nature of the digital object
created place unique and specific demands on organisations. Each of the
case studies is being balanced to ensure a range of institutional
types, sizes, and locations.

The main areas of investigation included:
* perception and awareness of risk associated with information loss;
* understanding how digital preservation affects the organisation;
* identifying what actions have been taken to prevent data loss;
* the process of monitoring actions; and,
* mechanisms for determining future requirements.

Within each section, the questions were designed to bring
organisational perceptions and practices into focus. Questions were
aimed at understanding impressions held on digital preservation and the
impact that it has had on the respective organisation, exploring the
awareness in the sector of the issues and the importance that it was
accorded, and how it affected organisational thinking. The participants
were asked to describe, what in their views, were the main problems
associated with digital preservation and what value information
actually had in the sector. Through this the reasons for preserving
information as well as the risks associated with not preserving it
became clear.

The core of the questionnaire focused on the actions taken at corporate
level and sectoral levels in order to uncover policies, strategies, and
standards currently employed to tackle digital preservation concerns,
including selection, preservation techniques, storage, access, and
costs. Questions allowed participants to explore the future commitment
from their organisation and sector to digital preservation activities,
and where possible to relate their existing or planned activities to
those being conducted in other organisations with which they might be
familiar.

Ten organisations in each sector, and three people within each
organisation are targeted for each study. In reality this proved to be
problematic. Even when organisations are identified and interviews
timetabled, targets often withdrew just before we began the interview
process. Some withdrew after seeing the data collection instrument, due
in part to the time/effort involved, and others (we suspect) dropped
out because they realised that the expertise was not available within
their organisation to answer the questions. The perception of risks
that might arise through contributing to these studies worried some
organisations, particularly those from sectors where competitive
advantage is imperative, or liability and litigation issues especially
worrying. Non-disclosure agreements that stipulated that we would
neither name an organisation nor disclose any information that would
enable readers to identify them were used to reduce risks associated
with contributing to this study. In some cases the risk was still
deemed too great and organisations withdrew.

Chapter 3: Method of Working
Initial desk-based sectoral analysis provides ERPANET researchers with
essential background knowledge. They then conduct the primary research
by interview. In developing the interview instrument, the project
directors and editors reviewed other projects that had used interviews
to accumulate evidence on issues related to digital preservation. Among
these the methodologies used in the Pittsburgh Project and InterPARES I
for target selection and data collection were given special attention.
The Pittsburgh approach was considered too narrow a focus and provided
insufficient breadth to enable full sectoral comparisons. On the other
hand, the InterPARES I data collection methodology proved much too
detailed and lengthy, which we felt might become an obstacle at the
point of interpretation of the data. Moreover, it focused closely on
recordkeeping systems within organisations.

The ERPANET interview instrument takes account of the strengths and
weaknesses from both, developing a more focussed questionnaire designed
to target a range of strategic points in the organisations under
examination. The instrument (4) was created to explore three main areas
of enquiry within an organisation: awareness of digital preservation
and the issues surrounding it; digital preservation strategies (both in
planning and in practice); and future requirements within the
organisation for this field. Within these three themes, distinct layers
of questions elicit a detailed discovery of the state of the entire
digital preservation process within participants' institutions. Drawing
on the experience that the partners of ERPANET have in this method of
research, another important detail has been introduced. Within
organisations, three categories of employee were identified for
interview: an Information Systems or Technology Manager, Business
Manager, and Archivist / Records Manager. In practice, this usually
involved two members of staff with knowledge of the organisation's
digital preservation activities, and a high level manager who provided
an overview of business and organisational issues. This methodology has
allowed us to discover the extent of knowledge and practice in
organisations, to understand the roles of responsibility and problem
ownership, and to appreciate where the drive towards digital
preservation is initiated within organisations.

The task of selecting the sectors for the case studies and of
identifying the respective companies to be studied is incumbent upon
the management board. They compiled a first list of sectors at the very
beginning of the project. But sector and company selection is an
ongoing process, and the list is regularly updated and complemented.
The Directors are assisted in this task by an advisory committee (5).


Chapter 4: Project Gutenberg
Project Gutenberg produces free electronic versions of literature and
reference works that are in the public domain. As the project has only
a few paid staff members (6), the majority of eBooks are scanned and
edited by volunteers. Available via the Internet since 1994, Project
Gutenberg is the oldest producer of freely accessible, electronic books
(eBooks). From 1971 until 1997 over 1,100 eBooks were created. In the
first eleven weeks of 2004 alone, three hundred new eBooks have been
generated. There are now over 13,380 eBooks available and the
production of eBooks is constantly increasing. Project Gutenberg is
dedicated to making these resources available to the general public in
a form that the vast majority of the computers, programs and people can
easily read (ASCII). However, most texts are available in a wide range
of formats for users to select.

New features have been added recently to Project Gutenberg's core
services. Specifically, the new Radio Gutenberg (7) makes audio and
video files accessible to the public for download as well as broadcasts
on their two radio channels and Gutenberg Music (8) makes digitised
music sheets accessible. This project focuses only on the preservation
of the eBooks.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (PGLAF) is a
recognised charitable organization by the US Internal Revenue Service.

Perception and Awareness of Digital Preservation

Project Gutenberg is one of the earliest web sites on the internet and
one of the earliest digital libraries in existence. They have been
active in creating eBooks for over thirty years and are aware of the
social benefits to be gained through preserving these resources for
public access. Project Gutenberg ensures that all eBooks are available
in plain text and other open formats to avoid obsolescence. The eBooks
are uploaded to two main servers (9) and can then be mirrored by over
thirty sites worldwide. The combination of open formats and many copies
should ensure that access to these digitised literary works is
preserved for the long-term.


The Main Problems

The major long-term problem lies in ensuring that copyright laws are
respected for all of the digitised works made accessible by Project
Gutenberg. Mirror sites exist in many countries around the world and,
as such, ensuring that copyright laws are respected in each can be
difficult. However, no eBook will be posted to the main site in the
U.S. without gaining copyright clearance.  Recent extensions to
copyright laws in the U.S. and Europe have presented new challenges for
the Project Gutenberg team. This is because no new works will be
released to the public domain until 2018. Hart believes that these
extensions to copyright laws benefit 'very few copyright holders at the
expense of universal access to literature and knowledge'(10). These
changes will impact the amount of research that needs to be done before
an eBook can be digitised and made available.


Asset Value and Risk Exposure

Project Gutenberg exists to make literature and reference materials
freely accessible to the general public in a digitised format. As
mentioned above, Michael Hart believes that free access to literary
works is vital for enabling the sharing of knowledge, art, music and
culture.



Regulatory Environment

Project Gutenberg must adhere to U.S. laws involving operation as a
not-for-profit corporation. However, these regulations are not sector
specific. Project Gutenberg must be exceedingly careful to respect U.S.
copyright laws regarding the works that they digitise and make
available over the Internet. However, once a publication has been
verified as being in the public domain, there are no other legal
restrictions affecting Project Gutenberg.


Preservation Activity

Policies and Strategies

Project Gutenberg scans literary works and employs OCR technology to
create eBooks. In some cases, eBooks are typed in by hand. The eBooks
are then edited by a team of volunteer proof-readers. There are
procedures and guidelines available online for volunteers to consult
when scanning and editing texts for Project Gutenberg to ensure that
all eBooks follow a standard format. Once the eBook has been produced,
it is uploaded to two main servers. The eBook is made accessible via
the official Project Gutenberg website and the Internet Archive site
and on over thirty mirror sites around the world. As there are no
access or distribution issues, Project Gutenberg encourages users to
save copies of the eBooks to CD or DVD.

Project Gutenberg believes that by generating a multitude of versions -
those stored on the main servers, on local servers (through mirror
sites) and those downloaded to CD and DVD - will ensure that the bit
stream of the literary work is preserved for access. This embodies the
philosophy of the LOCKSS strategy. LOCKSS 'uses the caching technology
of the web to collect pages of journals as they are published, allowing
libraries to take physical custody of selected electronic titles they
purchase'(11).  LOCKSS was inspired by the words of Thomas Jefferson
who said "let us save what remains: not by vaults and locks which fence
them from the public eye and use in consigning them to the waste of
time, but by such a multiplication of copies, as shall place them
beyond the reach of accident." (12)


Selection

Project Gutenberg aims to make digitised versions of popular literature
and reference materials in the public domain freely accessible to the
general public. As copyright expires, publications can be freely
replicated and distributed. Many of these works are out of print. By
digitising the out of print works, Project Gutenberg feels that they
are saving the publications from 'obscurity and ultimate oblivion'(13).
Basically, all of the texts can be classified into three categories:
light literature (such as Alice in Wonderland), heavy literature (such
as Shakespeare and Dante) and references (such as Roget's Thesaurus).
Mathematical and scientific works are also made available including the
Human Genome. There are no real restrictions to what Project Gutenberg
will make accessible. As long as the material is in the public domain,
they can be digitised and submitted to Project Gutenberg. However,
Project Gutenberg aims to benefit the widest possible audience and
therefore prioritise the digitisation of popular literature and
reference materials rather than extremely specialised works. Project
Gutenberg already have texts in over 31 languages and are especially
keen to increase their multilingual holdings.


Preservation

Project Gutenberg already has numerous plain text files that are 20-30
years old. In that time, many file formats have come and gone while
plain text is still readable on virtually all computers. The use of
plain text will also help to insure against future obsolescence. All
Project Gutenberg eBooks are created as plain ASCII text files. This
means that people with 'Apples and Ataris all the way to the old
homebrew Z80 computers' (14) as well as Mac and UNIX users are all able
to read the text files. Any open format can be submitted but the
Project Gutenberg team will also generate plain ASCII (15) text files.
Project Gutenberg encourages users to created new formats from the
plain text files to suit their individual needs. Once the eBook has
been generated and edited by volunteers, it is uploaded to two main
servers. The first is the Project Gutenberg site itself and the other
is the Internet Archive site. From this point, mirror sites can
download the redundant files to their own sites and store them on their
own servers.

Project Gutenberg uses the unique eBook number as the file name.
Therefore, if the eBook is the 10001 plain text file created it will be
named 10001. txt. Project Gutenberg will accept as many open file
formats as volunteers are willing to submit, but will also generate a
plain text version. Additional versions in other formats will be named
accordingly but with different file extensions (e.g., html, pdf, xml).
Each eBook has its own subdirectory that contains all versions of the
eBook.

Project Gutenberg have volunteers representing a wide range of sectors
(cultural heritage, government and higher education). Through these
affiliations, they keep up to date with digital preservation
developments. Project Gutenberg staff have ties with many
organisational leaders and informal collaborations on best practices
are common.


Access

The eBooks are catalogued by Project Gutenberg volunteers to include
the author, the author's dates of birth & death, language, eBook
number, and the Library of Congress classification to enhance online
searching capabilities. As the publications that Project Gutenberg aims
to make accessible are already in the public domain, restricting access
is not really an issue. Project Gutenberg is mirrored in over thirty
sites around the world. As such, they cannot accurately estimate the
number of downloads that take place across all of the mirrored sites,
but state that the equivalent of 1 million eBooks are downloaded each
month from the main central server (16). In an effort to increase
accessibility by non-English users, eBooks can be generated and
submitted in any language.

Project Gutenberg uses Dublin Core to describe their electronic
resources to enable resource discovery.


Compliance Monitoring

There are no external requirements that Project Gutenberg must meet.
However, Distributed Proof-readers (17) work to edit and ensure that
the eBook content is as accurate as possible. The eBook goes through
two rounds of proofreading where it may be examined by hundreds of
volunteers. Once the eBook has been proofread, it goes to the
post-processing stage. 'The ultimate goal of post-processing is to
create a plain text eBook with consistent formatting throughout, which
contains as few errors as possible, and which accurately reflects the
intentions of the author' (18). Project Gutenberg citations - for
example in the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC)- appear as their
own editions and, as such, do not comply with any particular paper
edition. In some cases Project Gutenberg editions are listed as the
only edition in existence. Project Gutenberg makes every effort to
ensure that they comply with U.S. copyright laws and encourages all
volunteers to verify that materials proposed for digitisation are in
the public domain. Guidance and advice on undertaking this research is
provided on the project website. However, the Project Gutenberg team
are ultimately responsible for verifying public domain status and
require that a copy of the title page be submitted for each proposed
publication to assist in this process.


Digital Preservation Costs

A registered charity, Project Gutenberg relies on donations to pay
their few dedicated staff members and for operational costs. Nearly 100
per cent of the operational budget is focused on preservation. In terms
of storage costs, the project founder believes that as disk drives
become larger and cheaper, the price of putting eBooks on computers
will become negligible (19).


Future Outlook

Project Gutenberg has already been implemented in Australia and Europe.
Project Gutenberg of Canada is being founded in the near future.
Project Gutenberg also hopes "to also create such projects in Africa,
Asia, and other regions. In particular, they hope to create projects by
which e-books can reach the masses via digital radio links to
solar-powered PDAs. In addition, Project Gutenberg will be adding more
multimedia e-books: paintings, sculptures, music, audio e-books,
movies, etc., along with a wider variety of text formats." (20)

Project Gutenberg will continue digitising literary works and aim to
offer over 10,000,000 eBooks in over 100 languages by the time they
celebrate their 50th anniversary in 2021. Project Gutenberg aim to
enable the migration on request of their plain text files. This would
mean that the plain text version could be generated in any type of file
requested on the fly. This is currently in test mode. Project Gutenberg
is also investigating creating the eBooks as born XML to allow easier
creation of other formats on demand (21).


Chapter 7: Conclusions

As the first and largest collection of eBooks, Project Gutenberg has
been preserving electronic publications and making them accessible for
over thirty years.  By adhering to strict guidelines regarding the
format of the eBook (plain text) for access and readability, Project
Gutenberg has also ensured that their electronic resources can be
preserved and migrated easily to other formats as needed.  By uploading
the eBooks to two main servers and by mirroring the Project Gutenberg
database on sites around the world they ensure that backup versions of
the eBooks are readily available if necessary. This multi-distributed
approach is similar to the preservation strategy Lots of Copies Keeps
Stuff Safe (LOCKSS) that is gaining worldwide interest. The combination
of open formats and the proliferation of copies downloaded around the
world should ensure that Project Gutenberg eBooks currently in
existence and indeed any new eBooks created, are still accessible far
into the future.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

The western popular image of slavery in the Americas is of enslaved men, women, and children working in agricultural fields. Though the vast majority of Africans were bought by American slave owners for field work, enslaved people could be found in most occupations in the Americas. But there were great variations in slavery across the Americas, much depending on the dominant local crop and geography, as well as the regional economic, political, and legal systems in place at any given time.

A number of enslaved males were forced to work as seafarers. Some even worked on slave ships. Other laborers were employed on sailing craft in inland waters and on the river systems that formed critical commercial links to the American interior. The itineraries of seafaring vessels sometimes offered runaway slaves a means to leave colonial bondage.

In parts of Brazil and the Caribbean, where African slave labor on sugar plantations dominated the economy, most enslaved people were put to work directly or indirectly in the sugar industry. There was a complex division of labor needed to operate a sugar plantation. Sugarcane field workers worked long hours planting, maintaining, and harvesting the sugarcane under hot and dangerous tropical conditions. The field slaves had to cut down acres of sugarcane and transport it to a wind-, water-, or animal-driven mill, where the juices were extracted from the crop. Factory slaves worked under hot, humid, and dangerous conditions to convert the sugarcane into sugar and rum. Skilled men, such as carpenters, maintained the factory and equipment.

Other laborers produced foodstuffs to feed the owner and slaves. Others tended to the cattle and horses needed to operate some of the heavy equipment and transport the products. After the sugarcane-derived products were produced, slave labor was used to transport the commerce to barges and ships for export into the Atlantic economy. Domestic slaves maintained the households and served the slaveowner’s family. Other agricultural crops also required a diversity of slave labor to support the plantation operations.

There were various forms and conditions of forced labor for enslaved Africans and their descendants. In the colonial British Caribbean and North America, some worked alongside free people, Native Americans, or white indentured laborers. In colonial British North America, there were two major forms of labor—gang labor and task labor. In tobacco and in rice, slaves were given tasks to do, and their work essentially finished when the task was completed. By comparison, field gangs worked in sugar cultivation throughout the daylight hours and around the clock during harvest season. Yet even in sugar, this intense regime lasted for six months of the year. The other six months were devoted to planting and tending the fields, which was less onerous work than cane-cutting.

European and American governments created brutal legal systems that varied greatly, according to region, but generally sought to defend coercive labor practices, allow for innovations in the slave system, and maintain the property of slaveholders whenever possible. Slave owners everywhere often needed more enslaved laborers during the harvest season than they did throughout the rest of the year. The problem was solved by renting out slave gangs: groups of slave laborers used to undertake specific work (such as road building and field clearing) who were then returned to their owners. Colonies that depended on slave labor devised systems that facilitated the movement of enslaved people among plantations, from country to town, between one form of work and another, as needed.

Domestic slavery was ubiquitous. We do not know the figures, but countless numbers of men, women, and children labored in the homes of slave owners across the Americas. Compared to field slaves, they faced distinct difficulties and dangers. A harsh mistress or sexually aggressive master could make a domestic slave’s life miserable and painful. Female and male slaves faced sexual dangers wherever they worked. Their male and female owners, including immediate family members, relatives and friends (and even the casual stranger) regarded enslaved people as their legal property to use at their leisure. Without any legal protection for themselves or their families, enslaved people were constantly vulnerable to sexual abuse by white Europeans and Americans, male or female.

The misery of life as an enslaved person cannot be measured simply by the nature of the work they performed for their owners. Moreover, their work was never ending until death. Those forced to labor in sugarcane fields of the Caribbean and Brazil faced especially high mortality rates due to tropical environments and working conditions, as did enslaved people who worked in swampy rice fields. Large numbers of enslaved males also worked in the punishing world of mining, notably for precious metals in Brazil and other parts of Central and South America
By 1830 slavery was primarily located in the South, where it existed in many different forms. African Americans were enslaved on small farms, large plantations, in cities and towns, inside homes, out in the fields, and in industry and transportation.

Though slavery had such a wide variety of faces, the underlying concepts were always the same. Slaves were considered property, and they were property because they were black. Their status as property was enforced by violence -- actual or threatened. People, black and white, lived together within these parameters, and their lives together took many forms.

Enslaved African Americans could never forget their status as property, no matter how well their owners treated them. But it would be too simplistic to say that all masters and slaves hated each other. Human beings who live and work together are bound to form relationships of some kind, and some masters and slaves genuinely cared for each other. But the caring was tempered and limited by the power imbalance under which it grew. Within the narrow confines of slavery, human relationships ran the gamut from compassionate to contemptuous. But the masters and slaves never approached equality.

The standard image of Southern slavery is that of a large plantation with hundreds of slaves. In fact, such situations were rare. Fully 3/4 of Southern whites did not even own slaves; of those who did, 88% owned twenty or fewer. Whites who did not own slaves were primarily yeoman farmers. Practically speaking, the institution of slavery did not help these people. And yet most non-slaveholding white Southerners identified with and defended the institution of slavery. Though many resented the wealth and power of the large slaveholders, they aspired to own slaves themselves and to join the priviledged ranks. In addition, slavery gave the farmers a group of people to feel superior to. They may have been poor, but they were not slaves, and they were not black. They gained a sense of power simply by being white.

In the lower South the majority of slaves lived and worked on cotton plantations. Most of these plantations had fifty or fewer slaves, although the largest plantations have several hundred. Cotton was by far the leading cash crop, but slaves also raised rice, corn, sugarcane, and tobacco. Many plantations raised several different kinds of crops.

Besides planting and harvesting, there were numerous other types of labor required on plantations and farms. Enslaved people had to clear new land, dig ditches, cut and haul wood, slaughter livestock, and make repairs to buildings and tools. In many instances, they worked as mechanics, blacksmiths, drivers, carpenters, and in other skilled trades. Black women carried the additional burden of caring for their families by cooking and taking care of the children, as well as spinning, weaving, and sewing.

Some slaves worked as domestics, providing services for the master's or overseer's families. These people were designated as "house servants," and though their work appeared to be easier than that of the "field slaves," in some ways it was not. They were constantly under the scrutiny of their masters and mistresses, and could be called on for service at any time. They had far less privacy than those who worked the fields.

Because they lived and worked in such close proximity, house servants and their owners tended to form more complex relationships. Black and white children were especially in a position to form bonds with each other. In most situations, young children of both races played together on farms and plantations. Black children might also become attached to white caretakers, such as the mistress, and white children to their black nannies. Because they were so young, they would have no understanding of the system they were born into. But as they grew older they would learn to adjust to it in whatever ways they could.

The diets of enslaved people were inadequate or barely adequate to meet the demands of their heavy workload. They lived in crude quarters that left them vulnerable to bad weather and disease. Their clothing and bedding were minimal as well. Slaves who worked as domestics sometimes fared better, getting the castoff clothing of their masters or having easier access to food stores.

The heat and humidity of the South created health problems for everyone living there. However, the health of plantation slaves was far worse than that of whites. Unsanitary conditions, inadequate nutrition and unrelenting hard labor made slaves highly susceptible to disease. Illnesses were generally not treated adequately, and slaves were often forced to work even when sick. The rice plantations were the most deadly. Black people had to stand in water for hours at a time in the sweltering sun. Malaria was rampant. Child mortality was extremely high on these plantations, generally around 66% -- on one rice plantation it was as high as 90%.

One of the worst conditions that enslaved people had to live under was the constant threat of sale. Even if their master was "benevolent," slaves knew that a financial loss or another personal crisis could lead them to the auction block. Also, slaves were sometimes sold as a form of punishment. And although popular sentiment (as well as the economic self-interest on the part of the owners) encouraged keeping mothers and children and sometimes fathers together, these norms were not always followed. Immediate families were often separated. If they were kept together, they were almost always sold away from their extended families. Grandparents, sisters, brothers, and cousins could all find themselves forcibly scattered, never to see each other again. Even if they or their loved ones were never sold, slaves had to live with the constant threat that they could be.

African American women had to endure the threat and the practice of sexual exploitation. There were no safeguards to protect them from being sexually stalked, harassed, or raped, or to be used as long-term concubines by masters and overseers. The abuse was widespread, as the men with authority took advantage of their situation. Even if a woman seemed agreeable to the situation, in reality she had no choice. Slave men, for their part, were often powerless to protect the women they loved.

The drivers, overseers, and masters were responsible for plantation discipline. Slaves were punished for not working fast enough, for being late getting to the fields, for defying authority, for running away, and for a number of other reasons. The punishments took many forms, including whippings, torture, mutilation, imprisonment, and being sold away from the plantation. Slaves were even sometimes murdered. Some masters were more "benevolent" than others, and punished less often or severely. But with rare exceptions, the authoritarian relationship remained firm even in those circumstances.

In addition to the authority practiced on individual plantations, slaves throughout the South had to live under a set of laws called the Slave Codes. The codes varied slightly from state to state, but the basic idea was the same: the slaves were considered property, not people, and were treated as such. Slaves could not testify in court against a white, make contracts, leave the plantation without permission, strike a white (even in self-defense), buy and sell goods, own firearms, gather without a white present, possess any anti-slavery literature, or visit the homes of whites or free blacks. The killing of a slave was almost never regarded as murder, and the rape of slave women was treated as a form of trespassing.

Whenever there was a slave insurrection, or even the rumor of one, the laws became even tighter. At all times, patrols were set up to enforce the codes. These patrols were similar to militias and were made up of white men who were obligated to serve for a set period. The patrols apprehended slaves outside of plantations, and they raided homes and any type of gathering, searching for anything that might lead to insurrection. During times of insurrection -- either real or rumored -- enraged whites formed vigilance committees that terrorized, tortured, and killed blacks.

While most slaves were concentrated on the plantations, there were many slaves living in urban areas or working in rural industry. Although over 90% of American slaves lived in rural areas, slaves made up at least 20% of the populations of most Southern cities. In Charleston, South Carolina, slaves and free blacks outnumbered whites. Many slaves living in cities worked as domestics, but others worked as blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers, bakers, or other tradespeople. Often, slaves were hired out by their masters, for a day or up to several years. Sometimes slaves were allowed to hire themselves out. Urban slaves had more freedom of movement than plantation slaves and generally had greater opportunities for learning. They also had increased contact with free black people, who often expanded their ways of thinking about slavery.

Slaves resisted their treatment in innumerable ways. They slowed down their work pace, disabled machinery, feigned sickness, destroyed crops. They argued and fought with their masters and overseers. Many stole livestock, other food, or valuables. Some learned to read and write, a practice forbidden by law. Some burned forests and buildings. Others killed their masters outright -- some by using weapons, others by putting poison in their food. Some slaves comitted suicide or mutilated themselves to ruin their property value. Subtly or overtly, enslaved African Americans found ways to sabotage the system in which they lived.

Thousands of slaves ran away. Some left the plantation for days or weeks at a time and lived in hiding. Others formed maroon communities in mountains, forests or swamps. Many escaped to the North. There were also numerous instances of slave revolts throughout the history of the institution. (For one white interpretation of slave resistance, see Diseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race) Even when slaves acted in a subservient manner, they were often practicing a type of resistance. By fooling the master or overseer with their behavior, they resisted additional ill treatment.

Enslaved African Americans also resisted by forming community within the plantation setting. This was a tremendous undertaking for people whose lives were ruled by domination and forced labor. Slaves married, had children, and worked hard to keep their families together. In their quarters they were able to let down the masks they had to wear for whites. There, black men, women, and children developed an underground culture through which they affirmed their humanity. They gathered in the evenings to tell stories, sing, and make secret plans. House servants would come down from the "big house" and give news of the master and mistress, or keep people laughing with their imitations of the whites.

It was in their quarters that many enslaved people developed and passed down skills which allowed them to supplement their poor diet and inadequate medical care with hunting, fishing, gathering wild food, and herbal medicines. There, the adults taught their children how to hide their feelings to escape punishment and to be skeptical of anything a white person said. Many slave parents told their children that blacks were superior to white people, who were lazy and incapable of running things properly.

Many slaves turned to religion for inspiration and solace. Some practiced African religions, including Islam, others practiced Christianity. Many practiced a brand of Christianity which included strong African elements. Most rejected the Christianity of their masters, which justified slavery. The slaves held their own meetings in secret, where they spoke of the New Testament promises of the day of reckoning and of justice and a better life after death, as well as the Old Testament story of Moses leading his people out of slavery in Egypt. The religion of enslaved African Americans helped them resist the degredation of bondage.
 Introduction in the study of ancient civilizations provides insight into how early human societies developed complex systems of government, religion, economy, and culture. Ancient civilizations emerged in different parts of the world, often along fertile river valleys where agriculture could support growing populations. These societies built monumental architecture, developed writing systems, and created enduring traditions that shaped the history of humanity. By examining their rise, their achievements, and their decline, we gain perspective on the challenges and possibilities of human organization across time.
