Introduction of global warming is an important subject. Global warming refers to the long term increase in average global temperatures primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This process traps more heat in the atmosphere through greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Scientists have studied this issue for decades and the evidence shows that the trend is continuing with significant effects on natural systems and human life. The discussion of this topic involves understanding the physical science basis, the social and economic implications, and the potential paths forward for mitigation and adaptation.
